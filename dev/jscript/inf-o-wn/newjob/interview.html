				<li>q. Can you explain white box testing?</li>
				a. White Box testing = Structural testing (i.e. the path through the code)
				<li>q. Can you explain Static testing?</li>
				a. Static Testing = the examination of the documentation for a system not actually using the application
				to test.
				<li>q. Can you explain the differences between SOAK and Performance testing?</li>
				a. SOAK = Testing the application over a give period of time at full load to give MTBF (Mean Time
				Between Failure) stats

				a. The UAT / OAT phase of a project is the most expensive.
				<li>q. What is regression testing?</li>
				a. Regression testing is a style of testing that focuses on retesting after changes have been made to
				the application or environment
				<li>q. Can you explain risk based testing?</li>
				a. Risk based testing takes the risk to the business for a business function and the complexity of the
				code and creates a map of which areas are of the highest risk to the project that can then be used to

				software failure
				<li>q. Can you explain the difference between retesting and regression testing?</li>
				a. Retesting – Is rerunning the same test to make sure that a fault/defect has been resolved.
				b. Regression testing – is performed after a software change or an environment change to make sure that
				the application still functions as expected.
				<li>q. Can you explain the average percentage of code test coverage in System testing vs User acceptance

			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<h3>Financial</h3>
			<h4>ING Direct</h4>
			<p>Didn't work with their systems per-se. Configured MTM to work much like QC (their current defects
				management platform) did.</p>
			<h4>UBS</h4>
			<p>Created tests for an application called Broker, a web application that was designed to be used by the
				advisers for managing clients. Advisors have the ability to add clients to their profile,place trades on
				behalf of clients,load the trades on behalf of client,do portfolio analysis,etc.
				· It was connected to the ASX test market.The other integrations were never completed.
				· Some of the tests we did were for Orderpad,Types of fees,Adding new client/advisor,Portfolio detail.
			</p>
			<h4>Macquarie Bank</h4>
			<p>Phase two of the DJED project is an enhancement to Phase one. The aim of this project is to introduce
				additional functionality to allow a user to search by multiple accounts and generate a consolidated view
				of the accounts.</p>
			<h4>E*Trade</h4>
			<p>Re-look at the information provided in the client-> E*Trade folder. It was to do with the share trades.
