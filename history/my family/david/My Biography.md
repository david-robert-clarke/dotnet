# David Clarke's Biography

Where did you obtain the fishing equipment that we used in Ireland?

What music lps did you own when you met mom? Which were your favourites?

What is your favourite meal? Medium Fillet Steak with chunky Chips, mushrooms and grilled tomatoes.
What was my first computer? When did I obtain it? I had the Sinclair Spectrum +3, which was released back in 1987. I remember buying the game Barbarian for it.
What was my first games console? The first games console I had was the Sega Megadrive. It was bundled with Altered beast. Dad bought Golden Axe for it too. It was released in the U.K. in 1989. I had it for Christmas.
What is my car ownership history? 3 cars: First car I didn’t own, but was the secondary driver on, the Peugeot 309 1.3 GLX. I used that car to drive my mates and I to aikido, back when we were 22(?) years old. I bought my first car, Ford Fiesta 1.4 TDCI, in January 2004, licence plate BW53 FWF. I owned it until 2009, when I left for Australia. I sold it to Charl, Alan’s wife; she never kept it for long.

What do I appreciate that dad taught me
Grilled, rindless Bacon Tomato on fresh bread from Safeway. If we were lucky, we'd have mushrooms and fried potatoes too. The bread was cut with a bread knife into thick slices, spread with a thin layer of butter. The sandwiches were cut in half in a rectangular format.

Learning to Swim. Chelmsley Wood Swimming Baths on Saturday mornings. I could swim without armbands by the age of 3 before I started junior school.

Riding a bike. I could ride without stabilisers around 3 years of age.

Football skills. Dad taught me a technique that involved moving the ball around the one leg while balancing on the other.

Fishing. While In junior school dad taught us how to fish when we visited our Nan in Ireland. We used the fibre glass rods with ratcheted, closed faced reels. We used massive barbed hooks.

Curries - Made from scratch, frozen, brought out on Thursdays, finished by Saturday. All recipes were taken from his curry bible. He’d make a huge pot of the base sauce and freeze it in small, blue Tupperware.

Sunday roasts - The roast potatoes, lean lamb and thick gravy. He’d cross cut the sprouts. Peel and cut the carrots widthways. Cut the white core out of the cabbage, which we would eat raw. The cabbage was cut up finely. All vegetables were boiled in salty water until soft. Gravy was made with Bisto Red granules. We’d use the water from the veg and the lamb (minus the grease, which he’d pour into the sink). Plates were kept warm in the oven before serving food on them.

Holidays to Europe - we rarely flew to our destination, with the exception of Lanzarote, Majorca, Malta. Most trips were Epic Car Journies to UK destinations, by ferry to Ireland and the south of France. The south of France trips were taken in conjunction with Uncle David’s family. Dad had a list of directions written on a piece of paper that he stuck to the dashboard. I remember journeys in the Austin Montego (87-94) and Vauxhall Cavalier (94-04). We stayed mostly in Caravan Parks in the woods. During the day Jon, Alan and I, would spend holiday time in the swimming pool, at arcades, at the beech, on hire bikes. We played cards with Uncle David’s family on the evenings. We’d enjoy just sitting outside on the evenings while the adults chatted. I loved the French baguettes and croissants. The bacon and tomato baguettes were mind blowing. The lunchtime tuna tuna and raw tomato baguettes were something else.

Music - Mom had a collection of records purchased from the 1960s which we would have fun playing at various speeds. Favourite albums included The Beatles, The Beach Boys and some track called “Goodness Gracious Me” by Peter Sellers and Sofia Loren.

Banking - Dad set up a savings account for me at an early age at Birmingham Midshires. He also help me setup a current account at Lloyds Bank.
