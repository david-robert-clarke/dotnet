# Margaret Elizabeth Clarke's Biograpy

## Beginning

For anybody who doesn't know me... my name is David Clarke, Elizabeth was my mom.
In this Eulogy I'm going to cover the following, Elizabeth's life:

1. Back in the early days.
2. With her family in the UK.
3. And in the wider community.

## Main

Elizabeth was born Margaret Elizabeth Leahy on April 1st 1946 in County Cavan, Ireland. The eldest of her siblings, she was brought up in the farming community. Elizabeth attended an Irish boarding school during which she gained an interest in medicine.
At 19 she emigrated to Wolverhampton England where she began her nursing career. She soon moved to Marston Green Hospital Birmingham where she met fellow nurse and good friend Pearl Spencer. Elizabeth Leahy's life changed when she and friend Pearl attended a party at the Ward End Social Club in the summer of '69. It is there that Elizabeth was to meet budding Engineer and amateur footballer Frederick Clarke. Liz and Fred married in 1973. The couple later settled in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where a new family life began. Elizabeth juggled family life along with work and her Jehovah Witness' community life. At home Elizabeth loved her garden, especially her many varieties of potted plants. Elizabeth referred to bird life in the garden as "mom's birdies". "Mom's birdies" continue to this day to devour any food scraps placed on the lawn. 
When Elizabeth wasn't tending to her garden she would relax in front of the TV watching a quiz show or completing her crossword puzzle.
 Mom had a childish sense of humour (which I've inherited). Often she would head into the kitchen. As she went about cleaning up she would belt out a song. One of her favourites was "Knock three times" by Tony Orlando. With thin walls and Dad in the adjacent lounge, mom's vocal efforts were met with a condemning "bloody hell Bett, could you keep it down!" This usually made mom laugh, pause and carry on singing much to Dad's dismay. 
Elizabeth was a pillar of the community, selfless, generous and kind. In England her life centred on assisting people in and around Castle Bromwich. She thought highly of that community, forming close friendships with people like Barbara and Violet. I have fond memories of Ireland growing up thanks to mom's close connection with her family and friends. Each year up until my late teens Dad would attempt to get the Austin Montego to the port of Holyhead. We'd ferry across to Dublin to visit Aunty Iris and family in her seaside estate. We'd head north to Cavan, stopping off in Navan to be warmly greeted by Berty's family on the farm. Our last stop and refuge for the remainder of our trip was "Nanny Leahy's Farm" in Cavan where we'd meet our pragmatic Uncle Lewis. 
The English have nothing on the Irish when it comes to the consumption of tea. Our visits to Irish relatives homes were always met with a friendly face and a "now, would you like a cup of tea". My mom would chat endlessly. You could sense how much she cared for her relatives. I personally felt how much Mom cared for me while I was away in Australia & NZ for 4 years. It was she who was the person who contacted me most frequently, keeping me up to date with family life and that of my relations.
When dad's health deteriorated due to a brain injury over a couple of years ago. It was mom who cared for him, visiting him frequently in hospital and when he was to eventually to arrive home after successful brain surgery. When mom's health began to deteriorate it was sons Jonathan and Alan who were there to ensure Elizabeth was given the best care possible.
Conclusion
I love you mom. May you always be remembered as a: fun, positive and generous person pillar of the community both in England and in Ireland And a loving mother and grandmother
