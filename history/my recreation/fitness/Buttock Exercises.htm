<P>works your hams, glutes, and some light lower ab work</P></I><B>
<P>Starting position</B> - Lie down on your back. Knees are bent at a 
comfortable distance away fromyour . You can keep your knees apart or hold them 
together (holding them together will increase the intensity by a bit). Arms are 
lying down at your side or your hands are clasped behind or above your 
head.</P><B>
<P>The move</B> - Squeezing your cheeks together, tilt your pelvis (area below 
your naveland ending at you butt) upwards until only your upper back is touching 
the floor. (Keep your feet flat on the ground.) Lower your body back to starting 
position. Do 15 reps.</P><B>
<P>Variations:</P>
<UL></B>
  <LI>If you would like to decrease the intensity of this move instead of 
  keeping your feet on the floor you can put them up on a chair still lying down 
  on the floor. Your bent legs should form a 90 degree angle. The other 
  variations may and can be applied here as well. 
  <LI>For added intensity you can extend one leg in the air at an incline of 30 
  degrees or so and do the exercise. This will also work your balancing ability 
  by making you work to keep your body in form. 
  <LI>You can also increase the intensity by holding a weight below your navel 
  on top of your pelvis. 
  <LI>By putting your toes up and having only your heels touch the floor you 
  increase the intensity by putting more stress on you hams to sustain that 
  postion.</LI></UL>

<P>this move can be done anywhere, it does not require any equipment and you can 
do thise exercise while you are watching tv, standing in line or 
whatnot.</P></B>
<P>works your gluteus maximus</P></I><B>
<P>Starting Position</B> - Either sitting or standing just keep your back 
straight. You may want to put your hands on the muscle to feel it work.</P><B>
<P>The Move</B> - Squeeze your cheeks together and then relax and return to 
starting position.</P><B>
<P>Variations:</P>
<UL></B>
  <LI>To add a bit of a challenge you can also pretend that you have a million 
  dollar bill stuck inbetween your two cheeks. Squeeze it and hold it 
  there...don&#8217;t let go not unles you don&#8217;t mind losing that million dollar bill. 

  <LI>To go one step further than the above variation you can also take a quater 
  and hold it inbetween your cheeks. Hold that position for as long as 
  possible.</LI></UL></FONT>
