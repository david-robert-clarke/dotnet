<P>
Paragraphs can often be quite long, wandering on with no clear sense of 
direction or purpose, boring the reader and obscuring the point of the 
message (if any) contained within the text.  This sort of paragraph usually 
deserves to be broken up into several paragraphs, since its sheer bulk 
dissuades the reader from attempting to plumb its depths.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they can be pretty short.
</P>
<P>
Really short.

Cool?</P>

<P>
If you want to force a line break for some reason, but it doesn't make sense to 
start a new paragraph, then you can use the line break tag just as I will do at 
the end of this sentence.<BR> See the forced display on the next 
line?<BR> How about there?<BR>
Or there?
