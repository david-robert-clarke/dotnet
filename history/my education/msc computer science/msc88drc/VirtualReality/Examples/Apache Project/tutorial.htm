<FONT SIZE=3><P>Well, hi there, and welcome to Uncle Sam’s, <I>the</I> best army surplus store this side of Texas! I hear from some friends that you’re lookin’ fer an Apache. Well, I got just the thing right here! You interested? Sure you are. Tell you what, why don’t you take it for a spin on the test range, to see how it rides, like. Just hop in.</P>

<P>What? You mean you ain’t flown before? Jeez kid, you think I let anyone use my hardware?!? Here’s what I say, I’ll give you a few pointers, and you can try it for yourself. If you like it, you buy it. Deal?</P>

<P>Okay, if  you wanna jump in now… mind your head. There’s not much room in these things. Right, what you see in front of you is your control panel, got that? Thanks to the marvels of 21<SUP>st</SUP> century battlefield technology, you can even take the panel out, and fly from outside the chopper! Go ahead, play with the levers, you’re gonna find ain’t nothin’ much gonna happen provided you don’t press the big red button. The what? Blue? Well that’s the ….</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">BANG</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>Ahem. As you may have guessed, that there little blue button fires the belly cannon, so kindly keep your fat finger away from it while I’m in the area. Where was I… oh yeah. That big red button starts the engines if they’re stopped, and stops them if they’re started. Simple isn’t it? Oh, by the way, you can only stop the engines if you’re on the ground, and movin’ <I>real</I> slow. Some kinda fancy circuitry takes care of all that jazz. What do you mean, what if you use the flight controls while the engines are shut off? What are you? Stoopid? If you ain’t got no engines ain’t nothin’ gonna move. The blades’ll tilt, yeah, but, err…. You <I>sure</I> you’re OK to take this thing up?</P>

<P>Anyway. The blue button, as you so cleverly found out, fires that there gun, but if you want to point the cannon someplace else to where you’re goin’, you gotta press the yeller button. What? Yeller! Yellow! You deaf? Right, you press the yeller, sorry, yellow, button, and the gun will point towards one of the nearest targets. If it can’t point thataway, then it’ll stay pointin’ forward ‘til it can point towards the target. Why? The reason the belly gun don’t rotate all the way around is to stop newbies like you from shootin’ their own tail off! If you keep pressin’ that there button, it will cycle thru’ the available targets, ‘til it runs out, then it’ll point forwards again. While the gun’s trying to track a target, that little yeller button will glow, and when the gun is pointing towards the target, the blue button, you know, the fire button, will glow. That’s yer signal to LET RIP!!! </P>
<P>If you want to, of course. Also, when the gun is tracking a target, you’ll get a laser sight showin’ you roughly where them shells are gonna go. Neat, huh.</P>

<P>So, all that, and we’re still on the ground. We’ve got the fun bits out the way, now we gotta concentrate on how to get this crate in the air and keep it there. Remember those little levers you ignored at the start? Those little babies are important. Look at them now. The one on the left, called the left lever (huh huh), controls the rudder and the collective. That’s the bit that makes it go round and round, and the bit that makes it go up and down, to you and me. When you push the stick forward, the angle on the blades goin’ round above you’re head gets steeper, and you climb. When you pull it back, the blades flatten and you drop. Careful now – not too fast remember – this is still mine until you’ve paid fer it.</P>
<P>Also, if you push the lever to the left, you turn left, and if you push the lever to the right, you turn right. With the left lever, you can do all that fancy stuff, but you still ain’t gone nowhere. (Up and down don’t count as anywhere in my book). To get yerself movin, you gotta take a good grip on the right hand lever. This one’s called the cyclic, and which ever way you push it, you go! Easy. A word to the wise, though, kid. If things start gettin’ a mite hairy, and you’re goin’ too fast (and it can easily happen – there’s a lot of power in this ‘ole girl), just push the sticks to the centre positions, and they’re in the dead zone. This could keep you alive – funny, huh. If you put a stick in the dead zone, all the accelerations it controls drop off, real quick, and this can stop yer from spinnin’, droppin, or just flyin’ on over that horizon.</P>

<P>Before you start, remember that if you hit the deck too hard, or taxi too fast along the ground, you’re gonna crash and burn. Hell, if you wanna drive fast, buy a car! Okay, if you wanna get goin’ now, press the big red button, them rotors’ll start to spin, and you’re good to go when the button glows red.</P>
<P>Enjoy yourself! Bring it back in one piece, y’hear!</P>
