Hey dude,

At this present moment in time I feel like one big worthless piece of crap.
Where the hell are the jobs at? I haven't had an interview since May. I've
applied to a load of places, the company list has been excluded because of
it's enormity! It seems that the Telecommunications industry slowdown has
effected nearly every electronics firm. I spoke to Dave Norman on Tuesday.
Did you know that Bob Cairns has lost his job at Infineon Technologies? Yep
the slowdown has hit him hard too. Dave said Bob's been sponsored to do a
Masters course in Aeronautics Engineering at Bristol University, good luck
to him. I don't know what to do at the moment, temp work seems a safe
option. You're a brave man getting involved in the Telecomms technology
masters course. If Dr "he wears a gimp mask" Williams wasn't involved, the
course wouldn't be too bad. Is the Digital Telecomm's lecture compulsory? If
it is, at least you'll have the answers for his MCQ's.
    Porn searching has become a hobby of mine since I was knee high to a
grasshopper. Natural big tittied ladies are my particular fav'. Have you
found any/do you have in your posession, nude picys of Kelly Brook? If you
have, please send them my way, I don't care how big they are (I'm talking
rack size).
    Over the holidays I took some more golfing lessons and started Aikido
lessons. Without those activities and the looney juice, I would have gone
mad. Talking about holidays, I went away to Majorca, Magaluff for 2 weeks. I
had to take a flight over separate from my friends, because the results day
clashed with my friends flight. The holiday wasn't too bad, the first night
was fantastic. Got absolutely wrecked, sung "Bohemian Rhapsodey" on karaoke.
Spoke to Philippa Lett (the good looking bird from the Sisters of Murphys
advert) and got her autograph, which is now pride and place on my bedroom
wall. Later on that same night I had many lapses in memory. I remember
walking on the beach, speaking to some Chinese people thinking somehow they
were related to Kelvin. I found the correct hotel but the wrong appartment.
After trying many appartments, and annoying many foreigners, waited hours in
the reception area. After sobering up I got back into the correct apartment,
it was 5:30am. And I'm proud to say I was very, very drunk!
    I'm off to Canada on Saturday for 2 weeks, gives me a bit of breathing
space before searching for temp work. In any case I'll see you, keep in
touch. If you're going out to a pub with the dudes, send me an e-mail with
the details. No doubt, I'll try and be there.

Dave

P.S. I got drunk last night. It was my own fault, I shouldn't have sat in
that teacup.
