<HR>
3 hour exam. <BR>Answer four of the following questions. 
<HR>
1. Layered models <BR>a) Describe, with the aid of a diagram, the OSI reference 
model. Give the most important properties of each layer. [15 Marks] <BR>b) 
Explain why the functions of flow control and sequencing are found in more than 
one layer. [5 Marks] 
<P>2. Data Link Layer: Mac sublayer <BR>a) Discuss shared access media with 
particular reference to the reasons for using it and the problems that have to 
be addressed. Give two examples of such media. [14 Marks] <BR>b) Sketch a graph 
of system throughput against network load for the pure and slotted ALOHA 
protocols and explain the main features. [6 Marks] 
<P>3. Network performance <BR>a) Sketch a graph of network throughput as a 
function of load showing the curves for ideal operation, acceptable operation 
and congested operation and describe the main features. With reference to the 
graph, define congestion. [6 Marks] <BR>b) Describe the difference between open 
and closed loop control when applied to congestion. Describe the leaky bucket 
algortithm. [12 Marks] <BR>c) A simple memory function for updating a moving 
average U based on an estimate f is: <BR><IMG 
src="Data Networks Exam Questions_files/eqn00001.gif"> <BR>Explain the role of 
the parameter a in determining the memory time. [2 Marks] 
<P>4. Cryptography <BR>a) Explain the reason for the use of authentication 
techniques. How does the &#8216;man in the middle&#8217; attack work? How can this be 
avoided? (Full details of an authentication protocol need not be given.) [7 
Marks] <BR>b) Explain the one time pad cipher. Why is it special amongst 
cryptographic ciphers? Why is it so rarely used? [9 Marks] <BR>c) A message is 
double encrypted by using the one time pad twice with two keys K1 and K2. Show 
that this procedure is no more secure than using a single encryption and 
calculate the key K3 that this double encryption corresponds to. [4 Marks] 
<P>5. Network Layer <BR>a) Explain the difference between packet networks using 
connection oriented and connectionless network layers. [6 Marks] <BR>b) Explain, 
with the aid of a diagram, the concept of tunnelling when used to connect two 
networks. [4 Marks] <BR>c) Explain the format of network address used by the 
Internet Protocol (IP). How is it normally written and what is the address 
range? How are these addresses broken up into classes? [8 Marks] <BR>d) How does 
IP form a header checksum? [2 Marks] 
<P>6. Domain Name System <BR>a) Explain the difference between flat and 
hierarchical naming systems giving examples of both (not including IP 
addresses). How does the choice between the two affect the provision of 
distributed database sources? [9 Marks] <BR>b) What are the four main functions 
of the Internet Domain Name System? [4 Marks] <BR>c) Describe the process of a 
DNS lookup. Explain the difference between recursive and non-recursive requests.
