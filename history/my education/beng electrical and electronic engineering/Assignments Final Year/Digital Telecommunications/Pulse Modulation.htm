<H2>Pulse Modulation</H2>
<P>We shall look at a number of different ways in which a pulse carrier may be 
modulated to effect communications, concentrating particularly on pulse code 
modulation and a number of techniques associated with it.</P>
<HR>

<DL>
  <H3>Pulse Modulation Schemes</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completion you should be able to give brief descriptions and comparisons 
  of pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), pulse width modulation (PWM), pulse 
  position modulation (PPM) and pulse frequency modulation (PFM) </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>If we use a pulse carrier to effect communications then one of 
  several parameters of the pulse train may be varied in proportion to the 
  message signal. We can distinguish between two types of pulse modulation 
  scheme: (1) <STRONG>analogue pulse modulation </STRONG>and (2) <STRONG>digital 
  pulse modulation</STRONG>.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <H2 align=left>Analogue Pulse Modulation</H2>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>In analogue pulse modulation, the carrier is a a periodic pulse 
  train and we may continuously vary the pulse amplitude, pulse width, pulse 
  frequency or the position of each pulse in its time slot in proportion to the 
  sampled messages of the message waveform. In each of these cases the 
  informationn is carried in analogue form although the transmission takes place 
  at discrete intervals of time. Examples of these modulation formats are 
  illustrated below.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left><IMG height=355 alt="wpe5.gif (8369 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Pulse%202.gif" width=651></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <DL>
    <DT><STRONG>Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)</STRONG> 
    <DD>This may be considered to be the pulse carrier equivalent of DSB-SC 
    amplitude modulation although it is not exactly equivalent as may be seent 
    when we look at the difference between <STRONG>natural sampling</STRONG> and 
    <STRONG>flat-topped</STRONG> <STRONG><A 
    href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/paths/pm/Sampling.htm">sampling</A>.</STRONG> 

    <DT><STRONG>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</STRONG> 
    <DD>The width (duration) of each carrier pulse is varied according to the 
    amplitude of the message signal. Signal recovery is easily acheived by low 
    pass filtering. 
    <DT><STRONG>Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)</STRONG> 
    <DD>The position of each carrier pulse within its time slot of width 
    <EM>T</EM> is varied. Signal recovery is acheived by measurement of the time 
    interval between this pulse and a regular clock pulse train operating at 
    rate 1/<EM>T</EM>. 
    <DT><STRONG>Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM)</STRONG> 
    <DD>This is directly equivalent to FM. The pulse repetition frequency is 
    varried in porportion to the message signal samples; signal recovery is as 
    for FM. PFM is used in low-cost, high performance analogue communications 
    using fibre optics where nonlinearities in the transfer characteristics of 
    optical sources impair the performance of PAM. </DD></DL>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <H2 align=left>Digital Pulse Modulation</H2>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>In digital pulse modulation each sample of the message signal is 
  converted to a digital number representing the signal amplitude at that point 
  in time. The information is then transmitted inn digital form as a sequence of 
  coded pulses. This scheme is often referred to as <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/paths/pm/quantisation.htm"><STRONG>pulse 
  code modulation (PCM)</STRONG></A> and this forms the basis of digital 
  communications and will dealt with later in detail.</P>

  <H3>Nyquist Sampling Theorem</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completion you should be able to state and explain the Nyquist Sampling 
  Theorem </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>From what we have learn't in the tutorial on modulation basics 
  we know that if we sample a signal at regular instants in time we are going to 
  produce a periodic spectrum. Nyquists theorem is concerned with knowing how 
  often we sample the signal to that we can reproduce it witout distortion. If 
  we have a signal strictly bandlimited to bandwidth <EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">W</FONT></EM> and at regular intervals seperated by 
  <EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">T</FONT>T</EM> seconds (rate 1/<EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">T</FONT></EM>) then the resulting spectrum is going to 
  be copys of the spectrum seperate by 1/<EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">T</FONT></EM> Hz as shown below.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=289 alt="wpe6.gif (5378 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Nyquis2.gif" width=536></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>Note that because we are modulating the original signal we see 
  its whole double sided spectrum of width 2<EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">W</FONT></EM> copied at frequency intervals of 
  1/<EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">T</FONT></EM>.&nbsp; Therefore we see that 
  if <EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">T&lt;=1/(2W)</FONT></EM> these multiple 
  copies of the signal spectrum are completed seperated, and we could filter out 
  one to regenerate the original signal without distortion. However if we sample 
  at too low a &nbsp; rate, <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>T&gt;1/(2W)</EM></FONT> then we see that there is 
  overlap between the copies in the sampled spectrum and there would be 
  distortion in the recovered signal. Therefore we can state the requirements 
  for sampling, the <STRONG>Nyquist Sampling Theorem</STRONG> as follows</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <TABLE cellSpacing=1 bgColor=#ffff00 border=1>
    <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TD><FONT color=#ff0000>A band-limited signal of finite energy, which 
        has no frequency components higher than <FONT 
        face="Times New Roman"><EM>W</EM></FONT> Hz is completely described by 
        sampling values of the signal at instants of time separated by 1/2<FONT 
        face="Times New Roman"><EM>W</EM></FONT> 
  seconds</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
  <P>
  <P>If we do not satisfy this criterion we cannot recover the original signal. 
  In particular we may see frequency components which do not exist in the 
  original signal. This is called <STRONG>aliasing</STRONG>. For example if we 
  have a 4 kHz input signal and sample at a rate of only 5kHz we will see 
  frequency components at (5+4)=9kHz which is removed by a low pass filter and 
  at (5-4)=1kHz which isn't i.e. we will see a 1kHz signal after low pass 
  filtering a 4kHz signal sampled at only 5kHz .</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>An example, which you may see in the laboratory, is that when using a 
  digital sampling oscilloscope which has too low a sample rate (i.e. with a low 
  time base set) and we look at high frequencies. We may actually see low 
  frequency aliased signals which are not present at the input to the 
  oscilloscope. Care must therefore be taken when using such instruments - in 
  particuar if the frequency of the signal you are measuring changes as you 
  change the timebase (sample rate) then it is probably oscilloscope aliasing 
  that you are seeing.</P>

  <H3>Natural Sampling</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completion you should be able to describe, temporally and spectrally, 
  the features of the natural sampling of a signal. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>In natural sampling a bandlimited signal <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>f(t)</EM></FONT> is multiplied by a rectangular 
  pulse train <FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>p(t)</EM></FONT> (the periodic 
  gate function) with period <FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>T</EM></FONT> (the 
  sampling period) to give the sampled signal <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>f<SUB>s</SUB>(t)=f(t).p(t)</EM></FONT>. It is </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>This is illustrated in both time and frequency domains below 
  below. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>We start with the information signal which is smooth in time and 
  has a limited bandwidth.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left><IMG height=132 alt="wpe1.gif (2459 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli1.gif" width=527></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>Our gate function is a rectangular pulse train which has a 
  spectrum which is the sinc function evaluated at multiples of the repetition 
  frequency.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left><IMG height=121 alt="wpe2.gif (3744 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli2.gif" width=602></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>Now we multiply these together (in the time domain). The 
  resultant is the convolution of the two spectra in the frequency domain, which 
  is particularly easy to evaluate due to discrete nature of the sampling 
  spectra. It is the signal spectrum, repeted at multiples of the sampling 
  frequency and multiplied by the amplitude of the sampling spectrum at those 
  points.&nbsp; Natural sampling is characterised by sampling pulse tops which 
  precisely follow the variations in <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>f(t)</EM></FONT>.</P>

  <P align=left><IMG height=127 alt="wpe6.gif (4210 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli3.gif" width=603></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>The original signal can be recovered simply by applying a low 
  pass filter to select only the baseband component of the spectrum which is the 
  same as the signal spectrum. It is clear that we do not need to use 
  rectangular pulses at all as selection of the sampling pulse shape serves only 
  to specify the shape of the envelope of <EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">F<SUB>s</SUB>(</FONT><FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM> which won't affect the result after 
  filtering.</P>

  <H3>Pulse Amplitude Modulation</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completion you should be able to compare, temporally and spectrally, the 
  flat topped sampling of a signal as used with Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) 
  with <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/paths/pm/NaturalSampling">natural 
  sampling</A> and describe the use of a sample and hold circuit for PAM 
  demodulation. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>In pulse amplitude modulation the sample pulses are flat topped, 
  and so, in contrast with natural sampling, do not follow the variations of the 
  signal being sampled. The digital circuit used to acheive PAM is referred to 
  as <STRONG>sample and hold</STRONG> and it comprises two operations: the 
  instantaneous sampling of the message signal <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>f(t)</EM></FONT> followed by lengthing the duration 
  of each sample to a constant value <EM><FONT face=Symbol>t</FONT></EM>. The 
  value of <EM><FONT face=Symbol>t</FONT></EM> is chosen to reduce the bandwidth 
  requirements: if it is too short the transmission would require execssive 
  bandwidth. It is important to note the distinction between this process and 
  natural sampling.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>In the case of flat-topped sampling our input signal is the 
  sampled at discrete points in time so its spectrum is the baseband spectrum 
  repeated at multiples of the sampling frequency as shown below.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=140 alt="wpe7.gif (3924 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli4.gif" width=593></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>The nect step in the process is the hold operation which amounts 
  to passing these samples through a filter to acheive the required rectangular 
  pulse shape - a filter with a rectangular impulse response <FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>q(t)</EM></FONT> . This hold function is 
  illustrated below. Its spectrum is <EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">Q(</FONT><FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=129 alt="wpe8.gif (2386 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli5.gif" width=592></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>The output of this filter is the convolution of the samples with 
  the rectangular hold function which corresponds to the multiplication of the 
  two spectra as shown below.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=129 alt="wpe9.gif (4186 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Sampli6.gif" width=594></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>This spectrum differes from the naturally sampled one, the PAM 
  output spectrum is obtained by multiplying together two frequency functions 
  and the original form of <EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">F(</FONT><FONT 
  face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM> is not 
  maintained - the replicas are not true replicas of the signal spectrum. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>If we were to pass this signal through a low pass filter as we 
  did for the natural smapling case we would obtain the spectral output which is 
  <EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">F(</FONT><FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">)Q(</FONT><FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM> . The way around this is to pass the 
  recovered signal through another filter, with a transfer function 1/<EM><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">Q(</FONT><FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM> This is referred to as 
  <STRONG>equalisation</STRONG>, and the additional filter is an 
  <STRONG>equaliser</STRONG>. The importance of the hold time <EM><FONT 
  face=Symbol>t</FONT></EM> should now be clear. If we use a shorter hold time 
  <EM><FONT face=Symbol>t </FONT></EM>then its spectrum will broaden and become 
  flatter and the distortion produced on the received spectrum would be reduced. 
  It is found that if the ration of sample time to sample period <EM><FONT 
  face=Symbol>t/T</FONT></EM> &lt;=1, the maximum difference between the 
  equaliser transfer function 1/<EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">Q(</FONT><FONT 
  face=Symbol>w</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman">)</FONT></EM> and the ideal 
  low pas filter is &lt;1% in which case an additional equalisation filter is 
  usually considered unnecessary.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>Why are flat topped pulse so important when a naturally sampled 
  signal is recoverable without distortion by low pass filtering. The reason is 
  that the need to preserve the sampled pulse shapes in transmission conflicts 
  with the basic advantages of digital communications. In transmission over 
  distances which require mid-path amplification, the effects of additive noise 
  would make the <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/pm/NaturalSampling">natural 
  sampling</A> format no better than analogue. When the pulse shape is not 
  important, as with flat-toped sampling used in PAM, repeaters may be use to 
  regenerate rather than amplify the signal giving giving more robustness in the 
  presence of noise.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left><IMG height=218 alt="wpeA.gif (2226 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Pulse%207.gif" width=253 align=right><A 
  name="Sample and Hold"></A>If the sampling pulse is very much smaller than the 
  sampling interval then the signal power at the output low pass filter (LPF) at 
  the receiver may be very small, requiring large amounts of amplification. An 
  efficient way around this is to use a <STRONG>sample-and-hold</STRONG> circuit 
  at the receiver, as illustrated here. In this circuit the switched is closed 
  for the duraiton of the sample pulse. If the source impedance R<SUB>s</SUB> is 
  small the capacitor charges to the input voltage level withing the sample 
  time. Between samples the switch is opened. If the load resistance R is large 
  the capacitor will retain its voltage between samples until the switch is 
  closed again. <IMG height=177 alt="wpeB.gif (2853 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Pulse%208.gif" width=254 align=left>The output of 
  the sample and hold circuit is therefore as shown: smoothing is obtaine dby 
  passing the signal through a LPF. The sample and hold is a reliable and 
  efficient PAM demodualtor with good noise a=immunjity and removes the need for 
  large amounts of equalisation. Note however that equlaisation is required 
  since the output of the sample and hold circuit is effectively long 
  flat-topped sample pulses.</P>

  <H3>Time Division Multiplexing</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completion you should be able to describe how PAM signals can be time 
  division multiplexed. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>With relatively short sampling pulses PAM signals occupy only a 
  small fraction of the sampling interval, and room is left between pulses into 
  which samples from other signals can be insereted. This technique of combining 
  pulses from <EM>N</EM> independant channels in a definite time sequence is 
  referred to as <STRONG>time division multiplexing (TDM)</STRONG>. The 
  principle can be applied to most pulse modulation formats. It is illustrated 
  below for PAM signals.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=194 alt="wpeC.gif (4433 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Time%20D9.gif" width=549></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left><IMG height=140 alt="wpeD.gif (3518 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Time%20D10.gif" width=367 align=right>Each of the 
  <EM>N</EM> message signals is band limited by passing it through a low-pass 
  filter (LPF). The filtered signals are passed to a 
  <STRONG>commutator</STRONG>, which, in practice, constructed from high speed 
  digital switches but can bethought of as a rotating switch which sequentially 
  switched to the output of each LPF. The commutator takes a narrow sample of 
  each of the <EM>N</EM> signals at the sampling rate (<FONT 
  face="Times New Roman"><EM>f=1/T</EM></FONT>) at least equal to twice the LPF 
  bandwidth as required by the sampling theorem. It also interleaves the 
  <EM>N</EM> samples within the sampling interval <EM>N</EM>. In the figure here 
  the result of this process is shown for 2 signals. In the PAM case the TDM 
  output pulse train so obtained is transmitted; for other pulse modulation 
  formats a further pulse modulator may be used. At the receiving end of the 
  channel the TDM signal passes through another commutator which sequentially 
  distributes the pulses to each of <EM>N</EM> outputs where each message is 
  recovered by low pass filtering. The second commutator must operate in 
  complete synchronism with the first.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=left>Note that the channel bandwidth <EM>B<SUB>c</SUB> </EM>required 
  to pass the TDM signal must also satisfy the Nyquist condition. Thus the 
  <EM>N</EM> interleaved pulse trains constitute a single pulse train with 
  separation <EM>T<SUB>s</SUB></EM>=<EM>T/N</EM>. The sampling theorem requires 
  <EM>B<SUB>c</SUB> &gt;=1/(2T<SUB>s</SUB>)</EM> in order to prevent 
  informaiton. The TDM signal can, in effect, be filtered to 
  <EM>B<SUB>c</SUB></EM> (low pass filtered) yet still permit separationn of the 
  constituent messages by resampling at the receiver using, for example, the <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/paths/pm/Pulse%20Amplitude%20Modulation.htm#Sample and Hold">sample-and-hold

  <P>
  <P>The input signal is fed through a sample and hold circuit. Each of the 
  samples is added to a sawtooth waveform generated synchronously to produce the 
  sum waveform shown above. This waveform is sent to a comparator with a 
  threshold set, as indicated by the blue line on the sum waveform. The incoming 
  amplitude , when added to the sawtooth, will cause a change in the time where 
  the sum waveform crosses the threshold. Therefore the the amount of time spend 
  above threshold will depend on the signal amplitude, and we have pulse width 
  modulation. With PWM, the information is actually contained in the relative 
  positions of the pulse edges. Consequenctly, the longer pulses expend 
  significant amounts of power which is not carrying information. The PPM signal 
  is produced by triggering a pulse generator on the falling edge of each PWM 
  pulse to generate a pulse of constant width. Note that although PPM is 
  generally an efficient analogue pulse modulation scheme it does require a 
  local generation of the clock timing since, in contrast to PAM and PWM which 
  carry clearly recognisable clock timing, the timing is lost.</P>
  <P></P>

  <P>Since the PPM system is bandlimited, it must have a finite rise time and 
  this must place uncertainty in the determination of the input signal which 
  must be proportional to the rise time of the system, inversely proportional to 
  its bandwidth. The uncertainty in the system is refereed to as the 
  <STRONG>resolution</STRONG>. Note, the resolution only has a meaning in a 
  system subject to noise and distortion since otherwise a given point on the 
  rise time characteristic will always correspond to the same relative timing 
  instant. Generally the accepted criterion for specifying the resolution of a 
  PPM system equates to the rise time. It follows that any two pulses in a PPM 
  train must always be seperated by at least the width of the system impulse 
  response.</P>

  <P align=left>The first element in the PCM receiver is a regenerator which 
  performs three functions: equalisation, retiming and thresholding. 
  Equalisation compensated for known amplitude and phase distortion in the 
  channel. Retiming is performed using a locally generated clock, at a frequency 
  extracted from the incoming signal, to sample the equalised signal at instants 
  of maximum SNR. In the thresholding operation decisions are made as to whether 
  the incoming bit is a 1 or a 0 and a new noise-free pulse generated according 
  to the outcome. Thus noise on the incomming signal is completely removed. This 
  signal may then be decoded and fed to a filter to regenerate the original 
  message signal.</P>

  signal tyo noise we assumed that the signal fully occupies the encoder range. 
  The SNR<SUB>Q</SUB> will be considerably lower for a weaker signal. If we vary 
  the step size making it smaller for low levels and larger near the maximum 
  input level then the SNR<SUB>Q</SUB> can be made constant over as wide a range 
  of input values as possible. This is referred to as 
  <STRONG>companding</STRONG>, <STRONG>com</STRONG>pressing the signal then 
  encoding it in a linear encoder and <STRONG>expanding</STRONG> the decoded 
  signal with the inverse of the compression characteristic. Since the SNR

  amplitude step size decreases in the form 
  <I>dV<SUB>out</SUB>/dV<SUB>in</SUB>=k/V<SUB>in</SUB></I>. Integrating this

  based on <STRONG>range coding</STRONG> in which the input waveform is divided 
  into a fixed number of ranges with different groups of bits transmitted for 
  the different ranges. This is the technique used in the NICAM (<STRONG>Nearly 
  Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex</STRONG><EM>) </EM>compression 
  commonly used for high quality television stereo sound signals. It has a 
  superior noise performance compared to </FONT><I>A</I> law for higher signal 
  amplitudes. For low input amplitudes only the least significant bits are 
  transmitted while for high input amplitudes only the most significant bits are 
  transmitted. </P>

  case of NICAM 14 bit resolution is used which is compressed to 10 bits with 
  for transmission using 5 ranges as shown in the table left. In addition to the 
  data bits a 3 bit range code must also be transmitted. Bit reduction is 
  achieved because the range code is transmitted for a block of amplitude 
  samples adding only a fraction of a bit per sample. NICAM has a sampling 
  frequency of 32HKz and transmits a range code every 32 samples representing a 
  time interval of 1ms which is <EM>nearly instantaneous</EM> as far as the 
  audio signal is concerned. To avoid clipping the range code corresponds to the 
  largest bit in the block. A schematic of a NICAM coder is illustrated

  <P>
  <P><IMG height=148 alt="wpe2.gif (3642 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/NICAM.1.gif" width=518 align=left>Since 3 bits can 
  define 8 ranges this represents an inefficiency. This is reduced in NICAM by 
  taking 3x32 bit blocks which would have 5<SUP>3</SUP>=125 range combinations 
  and transmitting these as a 7 bit code producing an overall delay of 3ms in 
  the audio signal. Errors in the range code would cause substantial distortion

  Hamming distance of 4.</P>

  <H3>Delta Modulation</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completing this block you should be able to describe delta modulation, 
  and illustrate a simple practical approach to delta-sigma modulation. You 
  should also be able to describe the types of distortion arising with delta 
  modulation and the technique of continuously variable slope modulation (CVSD) 
  for reducing this distortion by adaptively varying the step size </P>

  <P><IMG height=271 alt="wpe16.gif (4677 bytes)"

  modulation may be viewed as a simplified form of DPCM in which a 1-bit 
  quantiser is used with a first order predictor. This is illustrated in Figure 
  28 where a positive pulse (1) is transmitted if the signal is increasing and a 
  0 level is transmitted if the signal is decreasing.</P>

  <P>Block diagrams of an encode and decoder are in Figure 29 and Figure 30. We 
  note that <IMG height=31 src="Pulse Modulation_files/Image185.gif" width=171> 
  and since <IMG height=31 src="Pulse Modulation_files/Image186.gif" width=223> 
  it follows that <IMG height=31 src="Pulse Modulation_files/Image187.gif" 
  width=123>. Thus the estimated (predicted) value of 
  </FONT><I>x<SUB>n</SUB></I> is really the previous sample

  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/pm/Quantisation">quantisation</A> 
  noise <I>q<SUB>n-1</SUB></I>. In general the quantised error signal is scaled 
  by some value by a <STRONG>step size</STRONG> <FONT 
  face=Symbol>D</FONT><SUB>1</SUB>. In effect the encoder approximates a 
  waveform <I>x</I>(<I>t</I>) by a linear staircase function. For the 
  approximation to be relatively good the waveform must change slowly relative 
  to the sampling rate i.e. the sampling rate must be several times (e.g. 5) the 
  Nyquist rate.</P>

  integrating prior to delta modulation. This pre-emphasises the low frequency 
  content of the input signal, increases the correlation between adjacent 
  samples (thus reducing the value of the variance signal) and simplifies the 
  design of the receiver which need only by an integrator. This is called 
  <STRONG>delta-sigma modulation</STRONG>. A simple practical circuit 
  implementing this is shown here. The circuit is based on a simple RC 
  integrator. It will function if the output of the flip-flop is V volts (e.g. a 
  CMOS device). <IMG height=133 alt="wpe17.gif (2247 bytes)" 
  src="Pulse Modulation_files/Delta%2013.gif" width=338 align=right>The voltage 
  across the capacitor will be a series of positive and negative exponential

  <P>These too distortions place contradictory requirements on the step size of

  increased where the waveform has a steep slope and is reduced where it has a 
  small slope.</P>

  <H3>Adaptive Quantisation</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On competing this page you should be able to describe the principles of 
  adaptive quantisation with both forward and backward estimation. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Most real sources are quasi-stationary in nature i.e. their variance and 
  autocorrelation functions vary slowly with time. PCM and DPCM encoders are 
  designed on the basis that the output is stationary. Their efficiency and 
  performance can be improved by having them adapt to the slow time-variant 
  statistics of the source.</P>

  noise power). An improvement that reduces the dynamic range of the <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/pm/Quantisation">quantisation</A> 
  noise is the use of an adaptive quantiser. A relatively simple method is to 
  use a uniform quantiser that varies its step size according with the variance 
  of the past signal samples. Is its simplest form only one previous signal 
  sample may be used for the step size adjustment. Shown in Figure 24 is an 
  example of a 3-bit quantiser whose step size varies recursively with the 
  relation<IMG height=26 src="Pulse Modulation_files/Image176.gif" width=126>

  <H3>Adaptive Subband Coding</H3>
  <P>
  <P>On completing this block you should be able to define model based encoding 
  and spectral waveform encoding and describe the form of spectral waveform 
  encoding known as adaptive subband encoding. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>The coding techniques discussed so far digitally represent the temporal 
  characteristics of the source waveform. The are however two other basic 
  classes of source coding. In <STRONG>spectral waveform encoding</STRONG> the 
  signal waveform is usually subdivided into different frequency bands and 
  either the time waveform in each band or its spectral characteristics are 
  encoded for transmission. In <STRONG>Model-based encoding</STRONG> the source 
  is modelled as a filter that when excited by an appropriate input signal 
  results in the observed source output. The parameters of the filter together 
  with an appropriate excitation signal are transmitted and provided the number 
  of parameters are sufficiently small a large reduction in data is 
achieved.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>One form of spectral waveform encoding is <STRONG>adaptive subband 
  coding</STRONG> (ASBC) in which the signal is divided into a number of 
  frequency subbands each of which is coded separately. This technique can 
  digitise speech at 16 kb/s with a quality comparable to 64 kb/s PCM. To 
  achieve this it exploits the quasi-periodic nature of voiced speech which 
  manifests itself in the fact that people speak with a characteristic pitch 
  frequency. This permits pitch prediction reducing the level of prediction 
  error requiring <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/pm/Quantisation">quantisation</A> 
  and thus greatly reducing the number of bits per sample. Further reductions 
  are achieved by exploiting the fact that the human ear cannot hear noise below 
  about 15dB below the signal level in that particular band </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>In ASBC noise shaping is accomplished bit adaptive bit assignment. The 
  number of bits used to encode each subband is varied dynamically and shared 
  with other subbands. Subbands with little or no energy may not be encoded at 
  all. A block diagram of this is shown below.</P>

  Receiver</STRONG></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>The signal is split into a number (4 or 8) of contiguous bands by a bank of 
  bandpass filters (typically each covering an octave) and these are frequency 
  shifted using single sideband modulation to a low-pass form before sampling, 
  band specific ADPCM encoding and multiplexing. into a bit stream. The bit 
  assignment information is transmitted to the receiver allowing it to decode 
  the subbands individually and modulate them back into their appropriate 
  frequencies which are summed to create the output signal. The complexity of 
  the adaptive subband encoder means that there is a processing delay of about 
  25ms but this is no concern in voice storage e.g. voice mail.</P>
