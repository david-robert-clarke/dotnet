<H3>Forwarding Mail</H3>If you already have a mail account with an ISP or a 
freemail site such as hotmail you may want mail addressed to your Aston mail 
account to be delivered there. You may also want mail redirected elsewhere 
during vacation. Here's where you do it.
<P>What are you doing and why ? When mail is delivered to your account here your 
home directory on <B>pophost.aston.ac.uk</B> is checked for a file called 
<B>.forward</B> (pronounced <EM>dot forward</EM>) which contains one or more 
addresses to send the mail to (normally) instead of delivering it to popmail. 
For example , whilst I have accounts (and many guises such as 
webmaster@aston.ac.uk) on all the central systems in Aston I only want to read 
it in one place so all those accounts have a .forward file containing <PRE>                 oweng@aston.ac.uk
    </PRE>so all my mail comes to the one drop. <B>pophost.aston.ac.uk</B> is a 
Unix machine (as most Universities' heavy duty machines are) and generally folk 
who aren't in the IT business haven't been exposed to Unix so don't know how to 
go about it. And we got bored of repeatedly explaining it. Hence this form which 
will set the forward for you painlessly. 
<P>
<FORM action=http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/cgi-bin/forward.cgi method=post>Enter 
Username (thats <B>bloggsj</B> <EM>NOT</EM> <B>bloggsj.b.99</B>) <INPUT size=8 
name=username><BR>Enter Unix/POP3 Password <INPUT type=password size=8 
name=pwd1><BR>Re-enter Password for verification <INPUT type=password size=8 
name=pwd2> 
<P><SELECT name=choice> <OPTION selected>show</OPTION> <OPTION>remove</OPTION> 
  <OPTION>set</OPTION></SELECT> forward<BR>If setting a forward enter the address 
in this box <INPUT size=80 name=forward> otherwise this field is 
ignored.<BR><B>NOTE</B> if the forward is not a valid mail address then mail 
will not get delivered but returned to sender as unknown at that address 
("Bounced" in the jargon). So <EM>concentrate</EM>.<BR>You can test whether it 
has worked by sending an email to your Aston address and seeing what happens.
<P><INPUT type=submit value="Do It"> </FORM>
<HR>

<P>The above only affects mail received after you have set the forward.<BR>To 
download any mail previously sent to you at Aston temporarily configure your 
mailer thus
<P><PRE>    	Incoming (POP3) mailer: <B>pophost.aston.ac.uk</B>
    	Username &amp; Password as setting the forward.
    	Outgoing (SMTP) mailer: not relevant.
    </PRE>With <B>Outlook</B> (which supports multiple POP3 mail servers) it 
goes something like this 
<OL>
  <LI>Select <B>Accounts...</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu 
  <LI>From <B>Internet Accounts</B> select <B>Add</B>-&gt;<B>Mail</B> 
  <LI>Display Name: <B>Not important</B> 
  <LI>Internet E-mail Address: <B>Not Important</B> 
  <LI>E-mail Server Names<BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>My incoming mail server is a <B>POP3</B> 
    <LI>Incoming mail server: <B>pophost.aston.ac.uk</B> 
    <LI>Outgoing mail(SMTP) server: <B>not.used.so.anything</B> </LI></UL>
  <LI>Internet Mail Logon - Account name and Password as you used for setting 
  the forward. Don't use SPA. </LI></OL>With <B>Netscape</B>
<P>The Netscape mailer (upto 4.72 at least) only supports one POP3 server so you 
have to temporarily EDIT your current settings (assuming that you are using a 
POP3 server currently). So make a note of what you are changing so you can 
restore without trouble. Alternatively take a copy of your preferences file 
before you start - mine (Windows 98) can be found at <B>C:\Program 
Files\Netscape\Users\oweng\prefs.js</B> and (Linux/Solaris) 
<B>~/.netscape/preferences.js</B>. Then you can restore your defaults by putting 
the copy back where it started. 
<OL>
  <LI>Select <B>Preferences</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu 
  <LI>From the <B>Mail &amp; Newsgroups</B> Category; select <B>Mail Servers</B> 

  <LI><B>Edit</B>;
  <UL>
    <LI>Server Name: <B>pophost.aston.ac.uk</B> 
    <LI>Server Type: POP3 
    <LI>User Name: <B>As used to set forward</B> </LI></UL>
  <LI>From <B>Communicator</B> menu select <B>Messenger</B> 
  <LI>Select <B>Get Msg</B> from toolbar 
  <LI>Use same password as setting forward when prompted. 
  <LI>Mail is downloaded </LI></OL>
