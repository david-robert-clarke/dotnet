Design file:              rs232_st.ncd
Physical constraint file: rs232_st.pcf
Device,speed:             xc4010xl,-09 (C 1.1.2.2 PRELIMINARY)
Report level:             error report, limited to 1 item per constraint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



All constraints were met.


Data Sheet report:
-----------------
No constraints were found to generate data for the Data Sheet Report section.
Use the Advanced Analysis (-a) option or generate global constraints for each
clock, its pad to setup and clock to pad paths, and a pad to pad constraint.


Timing summary:
---------------

Timing errors: 0  Score: 0

Constraints cover 0 paths, 0 nets, and 0 connections (0.0% coverage)

Design statistics:
No global statistics to report.  This generally means that either the timing
analysis was performed on fully combinatorial portions of the design, or the
constraints specified did not cover any paths.
