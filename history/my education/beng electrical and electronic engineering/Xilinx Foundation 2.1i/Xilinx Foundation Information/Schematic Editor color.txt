Problem Description: 
Keywords: F2.1i, Aldec, foundation, schematic, editor, color, scheme, settings 

Urgency: Standard 

General Description: Foundation Schematic Editor does not retain a saved 
color scheme if a user defined color is specified. From within schematic editor, 
View --> Preferences --> Colors will bring up the Color Setting dialog box. 
If a custom color is selected from the slide bar and then saved to a color 
scheme, upon re-entering Schematic Editor the user defined color will not 
be applied to the schematic. 

Solution 1:


From within the Color Settings dialog box (Foundation Schematic Editor --> 
View --> Preferences --> Colors) the user defined color scheme is remembered, 
however, it is not applied to the schematic. Thus, if the Apply button is pressed, 
then the defined color scheme will be applied to the schematic.
