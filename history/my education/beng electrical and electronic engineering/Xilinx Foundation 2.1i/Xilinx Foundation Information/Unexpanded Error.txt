General Description: 
A Foundation 2.1i schematic project targeting a Virtex device 
yields a series of NgdHelpers errors similar to the following: 

ERROR:NgdHelpers:312 - logical block "I_from_net_GND" 
of type "GND" is unexpanded. 

This is the result of making a functional copy of a user HDL macro. 
When the copy is made of the macro, the associated edn file is not 
copied to the new macro name. This results in Foundation exporting 
the incorrect pins on the GND symbol. 


Solution 1:


Copy the HDL code to the new macro name, changing the associated 
entity name also. Then recreate the macro.
