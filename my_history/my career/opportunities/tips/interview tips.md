By Richard Donkin  -  Aug 31 2001 14:08:40
The interview is perhaps the oldest and most persistent form of recruitment. Psychologists describe it as the least predictive of all forms of selection. Well they would, wouldn't they. They may even be right but interviewing looks as if it's here to stay because: 
- It's the most natural form of communicating between two people 
- Its subjectivity appeals to those of us who prefer to trust "gut feeling" when we meet someone
- We want to recruit someone we like as much as we want someone who can do the job
- We don't need to prepare. We can just do it
- It's the way we landed our own job
- Everybody does it 
Many of these points could be listed just as easily to support an argument against interviewing but it wouldn't matter a jot. We can jump up and down and tear out our hair at the injustice, inefficiency and ineffectiveness of interviews but we might as well save our breath. Interviewing will continue. It might be combined with psychometric testing and work simulations but it will keep its place in the selection procedure because recruitment is about people, not automatons, and people are only human. 
That said, there are ways to approach the interview from both sides to make something which is so often an ordeal a more effective and enjoyable experience all round. The advice we include here is designed to help the interviewee, the job seeker, but an interviewer may find something of use here also. 
Verbal jousting
So many interviews start as if the last thing either party is interested in is the job. These interviews are characterised by verbal jousting in which each party is trying to score points off the other. This isn't helpful to anyone so it's as well to get something straight from the start. The reason the interview is taking place is because there is a job of work to be done and someone needs someone else to do it. 
This may sound obvious but, unfortunately, we cannot take anything for granted. Some people advertise a job without really knowing what the job will consist of and what qualities they are seeking in the candidate. This is particularly common in the burgeoning field of new technology where so much work involves the partially sighted leading the blind. 
In preparation for the interview it may be wise to establish the expectations of the recruiter. This could be discussed over the telephone but don't count on it. You may have to wait until the interview. It may be that you cannot deliver what they want and it would be better to establish this now rather than after making some commitment. 
Buying or selling?
Another thing to sort out quickly is where you stand in the negotiating stakes: are you buying or selling? Many interviewers make the mistake that the candidate is desperate to take the job on offer. This is sometimes true in a buyer's market but recruitment today has turned into a seller's market for most organisations. It will quickly become apparent in some interviews who needs to do the most selling. 
A good interview will quickly establish some rapport between the candidate and the interviewer. This rapport can be easily destroyed in sloppy interviewing. Here is a list of common failures betraying poor interviewing technique. Poor interviewers often: 
- Telegraph their desired response 
- Have not done their homework
- Ramble
- Do not take a written record of responses
- Dominate the conversation 
- Reveal their prejudices
- Ask too many daft theoretical questions of the "What if" variety
- Try to engage in amateur psychology 
Interviewing is one of those areas, like sex, in which people can and do believe they excel. Everybody thinks they can be Michael Parkinson or Anthony Clare. None of this helps the job candidate in getting a job but it might help to know that, however experienced the interviewer may seem, they all have human foibles. 
Management frailties
Personnel experts in the best companies have become wise to the frailties of their fellow managers and increasingly those conducting job interviews are receiving training in their approach. When process is introduced into the equation the candidate can expect to encounter the structured interview. 
Structured interviewing is designed to be more objective. The interviewer will be following a standardised pattern of questioning designed to evaluate a candidate's performance in specific areas. If, as we should expect, the personnel department has been involved in the process, the interview will be attempting to gauge the strength of certain key competencies. 
Five traits
Competencies are behaviours, traits or abilities considered necessary to fulfil a particular role. Boyden International, the headhunter, for example looks for five traits which it considers of critical importance for most executive positions: 
1. Problem Solving: Can the candidate quickly analyse a problem and reach a solution? 
Watch out for the question that says something like: Can you recall a situation where you had to demonstrate your skills in problem solving? What was the problem and how did you tackle it? If you hear a question like this in the interview or see it on an application form you know that the recruiter is pursuing a structured interview looking for certain competencies. Become familiar with this and make sure you have some practised responses up your sleeve. If they can prepare, so can you. 
2. Communications: Almost all managerial jobs require communications skills. 
Boyden is looking for evidence of presentational skills, listening skills and dialogue skills. So don't forget that talk you gave to the Rotary Club (presentation). Don't forget to ask for some clarification in the interview to show how well you are listening and remember to stress how you handled that case when you were a jury foreman. 
3. Motivation: This is a big subject. 
The questions Boyden is looking at, which are fairly typical, include: Is he or she a self-starter? How much directed and sustained energy can the candidate display in carrying out his or her objectives? Can he function under stress? Does he set himself high standards? All these questions are subjective and pretty arcane but so is interviewing and they are questions we must expect. Think of circumstances when you have initiated something in order to establish your credentials in these areas. Personally, I think that some of these male-oriented concerns are outdated but, for the moment, they fit the stereotype of the big company executive and potential job candidates should be aware of them and prepare for them in advance. 
4. Interpersonal Skills: A real mixed bag. Boyden identifies three key questions: 
Q. Does the candidate use charisma, assertion or insight to direct the behaviour of others? 
A. Go for insight. Insight is very fashionable. Assertion is out. 
Q. Does he or she demonstrate consideration for the needs and feelings of others?
A. I told you insight was the right answer. Think empathy. Everyone is looking for empathy. If you don't have any empathy, get some. Join Greenpeace. 
Q. Are you self-assured. Do you command respect? 
A. Another old fashioned set of questions. Who do they want? Nelson? It may be best not to argue but if the interviewer labours this question you might choose to ask HIM (SHE is less likely to ask such questions) if he has read Maverick by Ricardo Semler. If you do ask this question you had better have read it yourself. 
5. Administrative: Be prepared to exercise your left brain for this one. 
This is looking for signs of planning and organisation because there is a persistent belief, outlined as long ago as the 19th century by Henri Fayol, that planning and organisation are functions of the manager. This sounds fine in theory, but when Henry Mintzberg looked at how managers actually spent their time, the job began to look more like a plate-spinning act. No manager in Mintzberg's observations spent more than 10 minutes looking at any specific problem. 
None of this matters, however, because the people doing the recruiting are not looking for evidence of spontaneity, improvisation and sparky thinking. They are, to quote Boyden, looking for "the successful non-crisis handling of a dynamic job and the ability to prepare budgets, marketing plans, etc." They are also looking for evidence of an ability to delegate. 
Delegation is the great management skill, the great management cop out. Be aware of it. Know how to do it. Delegation is work sharing and it's more important to successful management than any of the other qualities put together. 
Realistic advice
I have leaned heavily on the Boyden advice, not because I think it is ideal, but because I think it is realistic. It conveys an accurate sense of the qualities that continue to be sought after in executive and management roles. Some of these qualities are changing as the management role is changing. A clued-up interviewee might challenge some of these perceived requirements, stimulating a discussion about the management role, but it wouldn't do to come over as a smart arse. Management is peppered with ambitious individuals who know how to play the politics in their organisations, how to keep their counsel and when to intervene. 
Political awareness is not included in Boyden's list but it remains an important management skill. 
Awareness is everything. If the people doing the interview come over as stiff and remote, then this may characterise the organisation they represent. You may ask yourself at this stage: Is this really where I want to spend a big part of my life for the next few years? 
Remember, interviewing is not just about landing a job. Interviewing is a way of helping two respective parties to reach a decision. Don't be mesmerised by the money. Keep one eye on your personal values and ethics. This kind of advice may sound corny and old fashioned in a corporate world often dominated by the promise of telephone number salaries. But in the long run, for the things in life that really matter - the well being and health of you and your family - it's a point worth remembering.

Dear David,

There are countless scenarios that could unfold when you are in an
interview situation - we've put together 10 bits of advice to try to help
you get through.

1) Try to have something to eat and drink before the interview even if you
are very nervous: a rumbling stomach or dry throat are going to make the
process all the more difficult.

2) Greet your interviewer with a smile and a firm handshake and introduce
yourself clearly.

3) Be prepared for the age-old question, "What are your weaknesses?"
Answer truthfully while at the same time using your response to highlight
your strengths. Martin John Yate, in his book "Great Answers to Tough
Interview Questions" suggests choosing a small area where you lack skills
and then focus on your ability to learn, e.g. "I haven't worked with this
type of spreadsheet program before, but, given my experience with six
other types, I don't think it should take me more than a couple of days to
pick it up".

4) Never make negative comments about supervisors and co-workers or blame
anybody else for something you have/haven't done unless you are willing to
balance it out with your own faults!

5) Fight the overwhelming urge to stare out of the window and make sure
you make sufficient eye-contact with your interviewer (if it is a panel
interview try and share your attention between all of the members of the
panel)

6) Try not to make evasive/general responses to specific questions. If you
are asked a specific question that you haven't considered in your
interview preparation, just take a deep breath and think about it before
answering. Interviewers will be far more impressed with a considered
response than an immediate one.

7) In order to appear honest, Mark Parkinson (author of "Interviews Made
Easy") suggests keeping your hands away from your face, nodding your head
to show you are paying attention, leaning forward when speaking and back
when listening.

8)Make sure you have questions prepared for the end of the interview so as
to seem keen and attentive. If possible, base the questions on things you
have been talking about during the course of the interview as this shows
you've been listening. Refrain however from asking about company benefits
and salaries - wait until you've got the job offer before you do this!

9) Tom Jackson (author of "How to Find the Perfect Job") suggests
questions along the lines of 1) What are the job's day-to-day duties? 2)
How much authority will you have over decisions? and 3) What would be the
best continuing education for you to consider if you were to have the job?

10) Thank your interviewer(s) for their time.

But first things first - applying to companies by which you want to be
interviewed! Keep reading to find out more about jobs that we think might
be of interest to you.

10 top tips for interview practice      
    
Almost all companies these days have their own web sites. Learn something about the company before you attend an interview. But, beware, don't come across as a know it all. Use this information to ask questions about the company. 
List on paper all the questions you think an interviewer could ask you. Use your experience and that of friends. Then prepare sample answers and write these down as well. Writing down the questions and answers will ensure you remember them. Practice with someone answering these same questions 

Think about your weaknesses. What would you be prepared to disclose as an area of your experience/skill that is currently lacking? If not asked, find a way to include this in the interview. Interviewers expect people to emphasise their strengths but do not expect to hear of a "need". They will appreciate your candour, it will impress them. However, ensure that whatever you disclose can be easily remedied. 

Go over your CV and plan how you will address any "time gaps". For instance, if you had a couple of months between leaving one job and taking up the next make sure you have a legitimate explanation. 

Make sure your past history, academic and work, is achievement driven. So, be prepared to talk about specific achievements rather than your job description. Explain how you feel/felt about a success or failure. Feelings are important. 

Questions. Avoid those that push the interviewer for a commitment - unless you are interviewing for a sales job. Good questions to raise are: 

"Can you tell me a little about the people who work in the team?" 
"How have other people progressed in the organisation?" 
"What is the decision process and time frame for selecting someone for this position?" 
Use the third person tense, not "I", when talking about the job. Avoid sounding as though you assume the job is yours. Don't ask: "What would be my salary in a year's time?". Instead: "What would the position pay in approximately a year?". 

Find something positive about the company from your web browsing that you feel the interviewer will know about and feed them the opportunity to talk (proudly) about it. 

If your CV does not contain a photograph ensure you have both a spare photo and CV with you. When the interviewer is going back though their interview notes it helps them to recall you. 

If you are not exactly sure where the location of the interview is make a test run or allow excess time to arrive. Regardless of how genuine the reason, a late arrival is usually viewed as your fault and a negative. If you can take/borrow a mobile phone. Should the train/bus/car be stuck in traffic, you can at least warn the interviewer of your delay. 
     

The first impression 
To begin with, the adage that cleanliness is next to godliness is apropos to the interview because the first impression is the lasting impression. Hair should be well groomed; faces should be clean cut; makeup, cologne, and perfume should be minimal and conservative. Invest some money in professionally dry-cleaning your interviewing clothes. Accessories including folders and handbags, should likewise be minimal and conservative. Respect business values and conventions. It is usually advisable to be conservative in dress. This means avoiding the latest look. For women this means looking tailored rather than feminine. 
Be on time 
While employers will not hesitate to keep you waiting, they disapprove of lateness in an applicant. There may be several sound reasons for your tardiness, such as an obscure office location or traffic tie-up, but none of these will help your cause. One suggestion is to arrive 15 minutes prior to the interview and wait out the time near, but not at, the interview location. When you enter the office 5 minutes early, note the tempo of the office and tune yourself accordingly. If you anticipate being late, show some courtesy with a phone call.

Maintain your self-confidence 
When you introduce yourself, offer a firm handshake, call the recruiter by name, smile and maintain eye contact without glaring. Those who do not are often regarded, albeit unjustly, as deceptive, evasive and lacking in self-confidence. 
Be on guard for any nervous mannerisms. For example, if you tap your feet or twirl your hair keep your feet flat and your hands crossed. DO NOT SMOKE even if the interviewer does, as this may be a clue to nervousness. Show politeness to the recruiter and do not ramble in your conversation. Be pleasant with everyone you meet, even receptionists may be asked for their opinion of you. 

Practice your answers to the most likely questions Perhaps the easiest, and therefore the most neglected aspect, is the question and answer sequence. If you believe that what you say is important, then how you say it is of equal importance. The characteristics you want to convey with your responses are self-confidence, maturity, and fluency of expression. Self-confident individuals impress the interviewer as someone who will be a good spokesperson for their company. 

Mature applicants are prepared to discuss their weaknesses as well as their strengths. A clear and concise expression will sell better than a rambling explanation. The sharpest candidate will have prepared answers to the most frequently asked questions included in this booklet. Though rehearsed their responses are delivered with tact and sincerity to represent the applicant truthfully. 

Be enthusiastic and positive 
It will not be unusual for a portion of your interview to focus on your work experience. Your experience will give you something to talk about, it should help you package yourself more attractively. Sell your experience with sizzling enthusiasm. For example rather than just stating that you won an award sell it with zest. "Mr. Johnson, this past year I was honoured with the Gold Seal Gold Award for working 80 hours weekly during the summer - and I am very proud of the accomplishment." Be yourself but be your most charming, polite, concise, enthusiastic and self-confident.

Topics to avoid 
In marketing yourself, think in the employer's perspective. Rather than talking about compensation during your first interview dazzle the recruiter with what you can do for his organisation. Benefits are best left for discussion in subsequent interviews. Talk opportunity, not security, your contribution, not retirement. 

Control the close of the interview 
As the interview winds down, it is time to trial close the interviewer to uncover his thoughts about your fitness for the position. "Mr. Johnson, based upon the information you have about me so far, do you believe that I am a good candidate for this position?" Chances are you will hear one of two answers. If yes, then be assumptive. "Fine, what is the next step in the interview process - would I meet with you again, or would I meet with someone else in the company?" If you find you are not a match, ask why. "Mr. Johnson, I appreciate that. Would you mind letting me know which were the areas that I was weaker in? Uncover the recruiter's objections and answer them immediately. If you are not considered a candidate you will not have another opportunity to sell yourself. Make a last stand to answer objections and to close on getting a second interview.

Don't let turn-downs get you down 
Accept the fact that regardless of your interviewing skills, you still may not get some job offers for a number of reasons that have very little to do with your qualifications or interview skills. Feedback from interviews where you have been turned down will be invaluable. Uncover what they felt you lacked and for what they were looking. 

Plan for the follow-up 
As the interview closes, thank the recruiter for their time and ask for their business card. This gives you the address for the follow-up letter. Whether or not the position appeals to you on the first impression, trial close the interviewer to maximise your chances for a second interview. "Mr. Johnson, I very much enjoyed meeting you today. Johnson & Associates is a great company and I am keen to meet with you again. I can really picture myself being part of this organisation." Whether or not you feel this way is not the issue. The point is that you want at least to have the luxury of turning down his offer.

Good luck!

No Elaboration on Qualifications 

Lack of Professionalism
    

 Cover letters     
    
Application letters are the first personal communication a potential employer has from you, so they should be business-like but allow some personality to shine through. 
Different types of application letters 

Letter responding to a specific job advert. 
Speculative letter/Referral letter. 
Thank you letter (after interview). 
Follow up to rejection letter. 
Although each letter has its own purpose there are some crucial dos and don'ts. 
Do address your letter to a named person and make sure you spell it correctly. If you don't know the name of the head of personnel, call up and ask. 

Be professional. Don't use coloured paper but do infuse some of your own style into the letter. 

Don't forget to get a second pair of eyes to read it through. 

Do type your letter unless specified in the job advert. 

1. Advert response
The most common and straightforward letter. Because it accompanies your CV it should be short and concise. It isn't necessary to run through your education and job history. 
Start by saying where you saw the advert and why you want the job. 

Match three or four of your key assets with the qualities they ask for in their advert, using their words and phrases as much as possible. 

Show some knowledge of the company. I.e.: "I feel my experience in the German banking sector would be of assistance to you in your planned expansion into Europe (as seen reported in the Financial Times Feb 1 1999)". 

Add a photo - it will help for the employer to remember you. 

If asked it is better to say your salary requirements are open to negotiation rather than pricing yourself out of the running. 

2. Speculative 
There are an increasing number of jobs which are never advertised - filled internally or though a network of contacts. This being the case, sending a letter on spec could bring about some surprisingly positive results. 
Always write to the head of department you hope to work for and say why you chose that company. 

If you are writing on a referral get that person's name in first: "I'm looking to expand my experience in working for a fast-moving consumer goods firm and Jim Smith suggested you would be the best person for me to speak to. 

Make yourself sound interesting highlight a few areas of expertise. 

Keep the pressure off. While you would like to work for x company you realise it would be a co-incidence should there be any suitable vacancies at that time but hope you will be kept in mind. 

Ask for advice in your career development. After all they are the experts in this field. It also allows you to keep the door open and communication flowing. 

3. Thank you letters
Terribly underrated but can do wonders for improving your chance of being invited for a second interview or better still singling you out for the job. 
Keep it simple. Say thank you for taking the time to see you. It was an opportunity for both of you to get to know one another better. 

Remind the interviewer of your key skills and refer to anything which they seemed particularly impressed with during the interview. 

End on a positive note. Look forward to taking this one step further. Repeat your initial application letter mantra of why you are best suited for the job. 

4. Rejection responses
Although the last thing you want to do is respond positively to the person who rejected you for the job - their inside knowledge of your performance could help you succeed in your next interview.

Don't sound bitter. Although it is perfectly acceptable to express your disappointment. After all, you thought you were the perfect candidate for the job. 

Unless it was obvious your interviewer hated you - you have a good reason for asking why your application was unsuccessful. They don't have to answer but if you ask them to assist you with your career development - the flattery might be of help. 

Because the interviewer has had at least one meeting with you they are the prime candidate to tell you if any vacancies better suited to you become available. 
     

 

 
Ten tips for a killer CV      
    
1. Keep it simple 
A CV is nothing more than a shorthand sketch of your academic and professional history. Use it to draw attention to your strengths without cramming in too much irrelevance. You can always explain to an employer the intricacies once they invite you for an interview. 

2. Lead with achievements
Make frequent use of active verbs, ie: achieved, set up, managed, attained, responsible for, led. Use bullet points to emphasise the key successes in your life. Don't write lengths of prose for job descriptions. 

3. Work reverse chronologically 
Start with your current employment and work backwards, remembering to include the name and country of your employer, start and end dates, your job title and a brief description, plus your accomplishments. If you are looking for your first job, list any RELEVANT work experience first, paid or unpaid.

4. Tailor your CV to the individual company
Employers can spot a mass mailing a mile off. So if you are applying for a job in Information Technology make sure that aspect of all your jobs is emphasised. 

5. Be honest
Lying on your CV is a waste of your time and that of your prospective employer. Adding six months to your time in a job can seem like a good idea, but if you are caught out you will have lost the job for sure. But don't sell yourself short. If you think the three summers you spent working for a charity in France show your knowledge of the country and its culture - then say so. 

6. Education
Give equal attention to achievements while at University - but not if you have been in the job market for more than two years. Captain of the debating team, student union rep, set designer for the university play all show you to be enthusiastic, a self-starter and full of initiative. 

7. Don't overcrowd your CV
Try to keep it to one page with a separate sheet for references. If it doesn't all fit, don't keep reducing the font size until it does. If your prospective employer has to work hard to read your CV, they will quickly lose interest. 

8. Spelling
Typos and grammatical errors mean your CV goes straight in the bin. No employer will want to hire someone who can't be bothered to check their own work. Don't rely on the spell check to pick up any mistakes, read it over thoroughly. 

9. Two pairs of eyes 
A fresh eye is useful to spot mistakes or offer suggestions. Once you've read your CV three or four times, it's difficult to stand back and look at it objectively. Never try and finish your CV in one sitting - always go back to it after a couple of days.  

10. References 
Check with referees before you use their names. There's nothing worse than using someone who has either moved on or holds a grudge against you. The best people to use for references are your current employer or a professor or teacher at your college/university - someone who knows how you react in a working environment.      

 
    The purpose of your CV is primarily to market you and your abilities to a prospective employer. Basically, employers want a CV that states what the candidate can do, how effective he or she will be and why they should talk to them. Traditionally, it includes your educational and occupational background and explains your ability to perform the job for which you are applying. Its secondary use is to indicate your potential for future success by evaluating your past successes. Think of a CV as a shorthand sketch, not an autobiography. If it works, you will have the opportunity later in a personal interview to go into detail about your background. Regardless of the structure that you use, follow these rules: 
keep it simple and don't clutter it with irrelevant facts 
make it legible and free of errors 
avoid poor duplications 
keep it honest 
start points with purposeful verbs such as achieved, gained, learned, served, responsible for, arranged, encouraged etc. 
state where you can be contacted 
The most common order of the basic elements in a CV is as follows:

Identification
Include your name, address and phone numbers. 

Mini personal profile
Whether or not to include one is up to you, but please read No. 3 of the article on the next page. 

Education 
See examples at the end of this booklet 

Work Experience 
Start with your most recent position first. Include full or part -time jobs, academic research, work placements and volunteer work. Include start and end dates. Use bullets to list accomplishments, skills and duties. (Bullets have no punctuation at the end and you should use an absolute maximum of six in one list.) 

Activities and Awards
List professional, academic or community awards or organisation memberships (especially if you've held a position of responsibility); Computer languages or software. If you have more than one point in a specific field e.g. music or sport, then give sub-headings so it is easier to read. 

References
provide them on a separate list and leave this element off your CV. If you put "available upon request " make sure that they are!
