By Richard Donkin  -  Aug 20 2001 16:10:54
For the British it is a CV, for Americans it's a resume. Resume, CV, whatever we call it, we know what it is. It's the piece of paper that used to be important when we were desperate to land that dream job. 
But life has moved on and so have we. We're on the executive ladder, mixing with the movers and shakers. Does anybody really care about your CV when you have just cut that merger deal, broken into a new market or handled a departmental reorganisation? 
Well, yes, they do, particularly if you are thinking of moving jobs. Even the headhunter will want to glance at your career details. That said, surely the last thing you need is advice on how to write your CV. You know how to write a CV. You have your CV in a file and update it regularly. Is it fair to assume all this? Of course it is. Unfortunately your CV may be looking something like the favourite jacket or handbag that looked presentable a few years ago. You need to bring it up to date. 
Review time
There are two documents in life you should review at regular intervals - your CV and your Will. The content of the former can influence the content of the latter. If you don't have a document that you can transmit over the internet at a moment's notice you should prepare something now and it may be worth focussing on the format. 
You may need something for a speaking engagement; your personal assistant or your marketing or public relations department may need something to give to outside inquirers, from the news media for example. There are various models to choose from and there is no right way to word things, but you should give some thought to the content and presentation, perhaps filing different documents for different circumstances. 
Your CV is an information document about you. Some of the information, like your educational qualifications, may fairly sparkle or it may be embarrassing. As a rule, the further you move away from your school or college days and the more experience you have under your belt, the less important those educational qualifications become. The old alma mater might catch the eye of one of your fellow alumni but don't rely on the school tie weaving the magic it once did. 
Form guide
Your prospective employer wants to know what you can do, not where you learned your stuff. He or she is looking at your details in the same way that a gambler studies the form guide. He wants to know your track record. He wants to know how you performed last time out. 
So keep a CV and keep it up to date but keep it with some other information in what you might call your career file. What is a career file and why should you keep one? The career file contains the information about you that you may want to consult in customising your CV.
But it does more than that - it contains reminders, memos to yourself about the real you. It may have the results of some long forgotten personality tests. It may contain an assessment gleaned from a 360-degree or all round appraisal of your performance collated from those who work around you. 
Sales tool
If we work from the premise that an employer is looking for evidence of your ability, you need to marshal the evidence in a way that convinces the reader to pick you out of the pack. In that sense the CV can be an important sales tool. The opportunity for an interview may hinge on the strength of your CV.
Alternatively, the interview may depend on a word of mouth recommendation or on your personal skills in selling yourself into a target employer. If you are the target of a headhunter the headhunter himself is likely to have his own version of your CV - one that is less sales oriented - but he may still want to compare notes. Only the most sought after individuals can afford to let their reputations speak for themselves. Even then it pays to keep your own record since reputations are soon forgotten in today's fast paced information industries. 
Whatever role it plays in the selection process - it may be used for nothing more than a checklist or an assurance - your CV is likely to be consulted at some stage. Headhunters collect them, career web sites collect them. You may be so famous that your career is written in lights or spelled out in Who's Who but it still pays to have a CV because this is a document written by you about you. It's under your control and control it you must because you may want to customise your CV depending on your future career plans. 
Task analysis
This is where a career file can be so useful. Analyse the requirements of your target job, be it a job for which you apply or a job for which you have been shortlisted by a headhunter. The clues may be found in the wording of an advertisement or your research may reveal the real task that you can perform for the recruiting employer. Not all recruiters know what they want. They know there is a job to do and they may think they know what the job involves but don't bank on it. 
Your expertise can be revealed from the start in some careful preparation, analysis of the task, and development of an action plan. In this case your CV can be converted from an information or sales document to a consultation paper. You are identifying the needs of the job and you are matching your skills to those needs. 
To understand this approach it pays to have a grasp of competency-based recruitment. Any application form from an employer which asks you to demonstrate skills or qualifications in specific areas has been drawn from a list of job competencies. Sometimes the competency model shines through in the job advertisement. If not, you find it on the form. Not everyone uses it but human resource departments like competencies because they involve a process, and human resource managers love processes. 
Leadership skills
Read the form or the advertisement carefully or listen closely to the job specification as it is outlined by the headhunter. If it becomes clear what qualities are desired, sift them out and deal with them one by one. If, for instance, the job description requires someone with great organisational skills you must highlight on your CV a job or a project in which you demonstrated your genius for organisation. If it stresses the need for leadership qualities then think back to past ventures when you displayed your leadership skills. 
If you keep a career file you will not need to think back because you will have catalogued your abilities or traits under subject headings. You will be surprised how much you can find about yourself that you have forgotten or overlooked. We're not talking autobiography here. We're talking about job-related skills. No-one working in information technology would fail to catalogue his or her IT skills. In the same way they keep an eye on their skills training needs so that they don't fall behind.
Suddenly your CV is no longer a dull record of past jobs, milestones and achievements. It is a living statement of your life - where you are now, even where you want to be. In career file format it may contain thoughts and feelings and ambitions. The file can be as personal as you want it to be as long as the basic CV matrix is there to receive any customisation. 
Changing your CV should be as natural as changing your hairstyle, the clothes you wear and the decorations in your home. You can neglect it if you want, but people will notice just as they notice your appearance. You may even choose the neglected look. It works well for academics. But do it in a studied way. Be aware of your policy. Whatever you do with your career file or CV, make sure that there is a philosophy behind it. And work on the details because details matter.
