WARNING:Place:78 - The IOB component "A2B0_A3B2_CONFIG_1<1>" could not be
   placed.
ERROR:Place:79 - There were not enough sites to place all selected components. 
   This is probably due either to lack of resources, preference conflicts, or
   macro configuration placement requirements which can not be met.
   If PAR has been run, please check the .par file for resource allocation and
   utilization and verify that there are sufficient resources to place the
   component(s).  Also ensure that all placement conflicts have been resolved. 
   If neither of these seem to be a problem examine the size and shape of the
   macros in the design to make sure they all may placed on the device at the
   same time.
