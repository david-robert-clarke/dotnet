  <H2>2.0 IPv6 ADDRESSING </H2>
  <DD>IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of 
  interfaces. There are three types of addresses: 
  <DD><PRE>       Unicast:   An identifier for a single interface.  A packet sent
                  to a unicast address is delivered to the interface
                  identified by that address.
       Anycast:   An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
                  belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to an
                  anycast address is delivered to one of the interfaces
                  identified by that address (the "nearest" one,
                  according to the routing protocols' measure of
                  distance).
       Multicast: An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
                  belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to a
                  multicast address is delivered to all interfaces
                  identified by that address.</PRE>
  <P>There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6, their function being superseded 
  by multicast addresses. 
  <P>In this document, fields in addresses are given a specific name, for 
  example "subscriber". When this name is used with the term "ID" for identifier 
  after the name (e.g., "subscriber ID"), it refers to the contents of the named 
  field. When it is used with the term "prefix" (e.g., "subscriber prefix") it 
  refers to all of the address up to and including this field. 
  <P>In IPv6, all zeros and all ones are legal values for any field, unless 
  specifically excluded. Specifically, prefixes may contain zero-valued fields 
  or end in zeros. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.1 Addressing Model</PRE>
  <P>IPv6 Addresses of all types are assigned to interfaces, not nodes. Since 
  each interface belongs to a single node, any of that node's interfaces' 
  unicast addresses may be used as an identifier for the node. 
  <P>An IPv6 unicast address refers to a single interface. A single interface 
  may be assigned multiple IPv6 addresses of any type (unicast, anycast, and 
  multicast). There are two exceptions to this model. These are: </P>
  <DD><PRE>     1) A single address may be assigned to multiple physical interfaces
        if the implementation treats the multiple physical interfaces as
        one interface when presenting it to the internet layer.  This is
        useful for load-sharing over multiple physical interfaces.
     2) Routers may have unnumbered interfaces (i.e., no IPv6 address
        assigned to the interface) on point-to-point links to eliminate
        the necessity to manually configure and advertise the addresses.
        Addresses are not needed for point-to-point interfaces on
        routers if those interfaces are not to be used as the origins or
        destinations of any IPv6 datagrams.</PRE>
  <P>IPv6 continues the IPv4 model that a subnet is associated with one link. 
  Multiple subnets may be assigned to the same link. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.2 Text Representation of Addresses</PRE>
  <P>There are three conventional forms for representing IPv6 addresses as text 
  strings: </P>
  <DD><PRE>     1. The preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are the
        hexadecimal values of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.
        Examples:
                   FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210
                   1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A
        Note that it is not necessary to write the leading zeros in an
        individual field, but there must be at least one numeral in
        every field (except for the case described in 2.).
     2. Due to the method of allocating certain styles of IPv6
        addresses, it will be common for addresses to contain long
        strings of zero bits.  In order to make writing addresses
        containing zero bits easier a special syntax is available to
        compress the zeros.  The use of "::" indicates multiple groups
        of 16-bits of zeros.  The "::" can only appear once in an
        address.  The "::" can also be used to compress the leading
        and/or trailing zeros in an address.
        For example the following addresses:
             1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A  a unicast address
             FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:43         a multicast address
             0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1             the loopback address
             0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0             the unspecified addresses
        may be represented as:
             1080::8:800:200C:417A       a unicast address
             FF01::43                    a multicast address
             ::1                         the loopback address
             ::                          the unspecified addresses
     3. An alternative form that is sometimes more convenient when
        dealing with a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 nodes is
        x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d, where the 'x's are the hexadecimal values
        of the six high-order 16-bit pieces of the address, and the 'd's
        are the decimal values of the four low-order 8-bit pieces of the
        address (standard IPv4 representation).  Examples:
             0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3
             0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38
        or in compressed form:
             ::13.1.68.3
             ::FFFF:129.144.52.38
   2.3 Address Type Representation</PRE>
  <P>The specific type of an IPv6 address is indicated by the leading bits in 
  the address. The variable-length field comprising these leading bits is called 
  the Format Prefix (FP). The initial allocation of these prefixes is as 
  follows: </P>
  <DD><PRE>        Allocation                         Prefix         Fraction of
                                           (binary)       Address Space
        -------------------------------    --------       -------------

        Reserved for NSAP Allocation       0000 001       1/128
        Reserved for IPX Allocation        0000 010       1/128
        Unassigned                         0000 011       1/128

        Unassigned                         011            1/8
        Reserved for Geographic-

        Multicast Addresses                1111 1111      1/256
        Note: The "unspecified address" (see section 2.4.2), the
        loopback address (see section 2.4.3), and the IPv6 Addresses
        with Embedded IPv4 Addresses (see section 2.4.4), are assigned
        out of the 0000 0000 format prefix space.</PRE>
  <P>This allocation supports the direct allocation of provider addresses, local 
  use addresses, and multicast addresses. Space is reserved for NSAP addresses, 
  IPX addresses, and geographic addresses. The remainder of the address space is 
  unassigned for future use. This can be used for expansion of existing use 
  (e.g., additional provider addresses, etc.) or new uses (e.g., separate 
  locators and identifiers). Fifteen percent of the address space is initially 
  </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>allocated. The remaining 85% is reserved for future use. </H2>
  <DD>Unicast addresses are distinguished from multicast addresses by the value 
  of the high-order octet of the addresses: a value of FF (11111111) identifies 
  an address as a multicast address; any other value identifies an address as a 
  unicast address. Anycast addresses are taken from the unicast address space, 
  and are not syntactically distinguishable from unicast addresses. 
  <DD><PRE>   2.4 Unicast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>The IPv6 unicast address is contiguous bit-wise maskable, similar to IPv4 
  addresses under Class-less Interdomain Routing [CIDR]. 
  <P>There are several forms of unicast address assignment in IPv6, including 
  the global provider based unicast address, the geographic based unicast 
  address, the NSAP address, the IPX hierarchical address, the site-local-use 
  address, the link-local-use address, and the IPv4-capable host address. 
  Additional address types can be defined in the future. 
  <P>IPv6 nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the internal 
  structure of the IPv6 address, depending on the role the node plays (for 
  instance, host versus router). At a minimum, a node may consider that unicast 
  addresses (including its own) have no internal structure: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |                           128 bits                              |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                          node address                           |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+</PRE>
  <P>A slightly sophisticated host (but still rather simple) may additionally be 
  aware of subnet prefix(es) for the link(s) it is attached to, where different 
  addresses may have different values for n: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |                         n bits                 |   128-n bits   |
    +------------------------------------------------+----------------+
    |                   subnet prefix                | interface ID   |
    +------------------------------------------------+----------------+</PRE>
  <P>Still more sophisticated hosts may be aware of other hierarchical 
  boundaries in the unicast address. Though a very simple router may have no 
  knowledge of the internal structure of IPv6 unicast addresses, routers will 
  more generally have knowledge of one or more of the hierarchical boundaries 
  for the operation of routing protocols. The known boundaries will differ from 
  router to router, depending on what positions the router holds in the routing 
  hierarchy. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.1 Unicast Address Examples</PRE>
  <P>An example of a Unicast address format which will likely be common on LANs 
  and other environments where IEEE 802 MAC addresses are available is: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |              n bits            | 80-n bits |     48 bits        |
    +--------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+
    |        subscriber prefix       | subnet ID |   interface ID     |
    +--------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+</PRE>
  <P>Where the 48-bit Interface ID is an IEEE-802 MAC address. The use of IEEE 
  802 MAC addresses as a interface ID is expected to be very common in 
  environments where nodes have an IEEE 802 MAC address. In other environments, 
  where IEEE 802 MAC addresses are not available, other types of link layer 
  addresses can be used, such as E.164 addresses, for the interface ID. 
  <P>The inclusion of a unique global interface identifier, such as an IEEE MAC 
  address, makes possible a very simple form of auto- configuration of 
  addresses. A node may discover a subnet ID by listening to Router 
  Advertisement messages sent by a router on its attached link(s), and then 
  fabricating an IPv6 address for itself by using its IEEE MAC address as the 
  interface ID on that subnet. 
  <P>Another unicast address format example is where a site or organization 
  requires additional layers of internal hierarchy. In this example the subnet 
  ID is divided into an area ID and a subnet ID. Its format is: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |         s bits       | n bits  |   m bits     | 128-s-n-m bits  |
    +----------------------+---------+--------------+-----------------+
    |   subscriber prefix  | area ID |  subnet ID   |  interface ID   |
    +----------------------+---------+--------------+-----------------+</PRE>
  <P>This technique can be continued to allow a site or organization to add 
  additional layers of internal hierarchy. It may be desirable to use an 
  interface ID smaller than a 48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address to allow more space 
  for the additional layers of internal hierarchy. These could be interface IDs 
  which are administratively created by the site or organization. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.2 The Unspecified Address</PRE>
  <P>The address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 is called the unspecified address. It must 
  never be assigned to any node. It indicates the absence of an address. One 
  example of its use is in the Source Address field of any IPv6 datagrams sent 
  by an initializing host before it has learned its own address. 
  <P>The unspecified address must not be used as the destination address of IPv6 
  datagrams or in IPv6 Routing Headers. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.3 The Loopback Address</PRE>
  <P>The unicast address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is called the loopback address. It may 
  be used by a node to send an IPv6 datagram to itself. It may never be assigned 
  to any interface. 
  <P>The loopback address must not be used as the source address in IPv6 
  datagrams that are sent outside of a single node. An IPv6 datagram with a 
  destination address of loopback must never be sent outside of a single node. 
  </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.4 IPv6 Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses</PRE>
  <P>The IPv6 transition mechanisms include a technique for hosts and routers to 
  dynamically tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 routing infrastructure. IPv6 nodes 
  that utilize this technique are assigned special IPv6 unicast addresses that 
  carry an IPv4 address in the low-order 32-bits. This type of address is termed 
  an "IPv4- compatible IPv6 address" and has the format: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
    |0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     |
    +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+</PRE>
  <P>A second type of IPv6 address which holds an embedded IPv4 address is also 
  defined. This address is used to represent the addresses of IPv4-only nodes 
  (those that *do not* support IPv6) as IPv6 addresses. This type of address is 
  termed an "IPv4-mapped IPv6 address" and has the format: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
    |0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     |
    +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+
   2.4.5 NSAP Addresses</PRE>
  <P>This mapping of NSAP address into IPv6 addresses is as follows: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |   7   |                   121 bits                              |
    +-------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    |0000001|                 to be defined                           |
    +-------+---------------------------------------------------------+</PRE>
  <P>The draft definition, motivation, and usage are under study [NSAP]. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.6 IPX Addresses</PRE>
  <P>This mapping of IPX address into IPv6 addresses is as follows: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |   7   |                   121 bits                              |
    +-------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    |0000010|                 to be defined                           |
    +-------+---------------------------------------------------------+</PRE>
  <P>The draft definition, motivation, and usage are under study. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.7 Provider-Based Global Unicast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>The global provider-based unicast address is assigned as described in 
  [ALLOC]. This initial assignment plan for these unicast addresses is similar 
  to assignment of IPv4 addresses under the CIDR scheme [CIDR]. The IPv6 global 
  provider-based unicast address format is as follows: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    | 3 |  n bits   |  m bits   |   o bits    |   125-n-m-o bits   |
    +---+-----------+-----------+-------------+--------------------+
    |010|registry ID|provider ID|subscriber ID|  intra-subscriber  |
    +---+-----------+-----------+-------------+--------------------+</PRE>The 
  high-order part of the address is assigned to registries, who then assign 
  portions of the address space to providers, who then assign portions of the 
  address space to subscribers, etc. 
  <P>The registry ID identifies the registry which assigns the provider portion 
  of the address. The term "registry prefix" refers to the high-order part of 
  the address up to and including the registry ID. 
  <P>The provider ID identifies a specific provider which assigns the subscriber 
  portion of the address. The term "provider prefix" refers to the high-order 
  part of the address up to and including the provider ID. 
  <P>The subscriber ID distinguishes among multiple subscribers attached to the 
  provider identified by the provider ID. The term "subscriber prefix" refers to 
  the high-order part of the address up to and including the subscriber ID. 
  <P>The intra-subscriber portion of the address is defined by an individual 
  subscriber and is organized according to the subscribers local internet 
  topology. It is likely that many subscribers will choose to divide the 
  intra-subscriber portion of the address into a subnet ID and an interface ID. 
  In this case the subnet ID identifies a specific physical link and the 
  interface ID identifies a single interface on that subnet. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.4.8 Local-use IPv6 Unicast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>There are two types of local-use unicast addresses defined. These are 
  Link-Local and Site-Local. The Link-Local is for use on a single link and the 
  Site-Local is for use in a single site. Link-Local addresses have the

  <P>Link-Local addresses are designed to be used for addressing on a single 
  link for purposes such as auto-address configuration, neighbor discovery, or 
  when no routers are present. 
  <P>Routers MUST not forward any packets with link-local source addresses. 
  Site-Local addresses have the following format: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |   10     |

    +----------+---------+---------------+----------------------------+</PRE>
  <P>Site-Local addresses may be used for sites or organizations that are not 
  (yet) connected to the global Internet. They do not need to request or "steal" 
  an address prefix from the global Internet address space. IPv6 site-local 
  addresses can be used instead. When the organization connects to the global 
  Internet, it can then form global addresses by replacing the site-local prefix 
  with a subscriber prefix. 
  <P>Routers MUST not forward any packets with site-local source addresses 
  outside of the site. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.5 Anycast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>An IPv6 anycast address is an address that is assigned to more than one 
  interface (typically belonging to different nodes), with the property that a 
  packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the "nearest" interface having 
  that address, according to the routing protocols' measure of distance. 
  <P>Anycast addresses are allocated from the unicast address space, using any 
  of the defined unicast address formats. Thus, anycast addresses are 
  syntactically indistinguishable from unicast addresses. When a unicast address 
  is assigned to more than one interface, thus turning it into an anycast 
  address, the nodes to which the address is assigned must be explicitly 
  configured to know that it is an anycast address. 
  <P>For any assigned anycast address, there is a longest address prefix P that 
  identifies the topological region in which all interfaces belonging to that 
  anycast address reside. Within the region identified by P, each member of the 
  anycast set must be advertised as a separate entry in the routing system 
  (commonly referred to as a "host route"); outside the region identified by P, 
  the anycast address may be aggregated into the routing advertisement for 
  prefix P. 
  <P>Note that in, the worst case, the prefix P of an anycast set may be the 
  null prefix, i.e., the members of the set may have no topological locality. In 
  that case, the anycast address must be advertised as a separate routing entry 
  throughout the entire internet, which presents a severe scaling limit on how 
  many such "global" anycast sets may be supported. Therefore, it is expected 
  that support for global anycast sets may be unavailable or very restricted. 
  <P>One expected use of anycast addresses is to identify the set of routers 
  belonging to an internet service provider. Such addresses could be used as 
  intermediate addresses in an IPv6 Routing header, to cause a packet to be 
  delivered via a particular provider or sequence of providers. Some other 
  possible uses are to identify the set of routers attached to a particular 
  subnet, or the set of routers providing entry into a particular routing 
  domain. 
  <P>There is little experience with widespread, arbitrary use of internet 
  anycast addresses, and some known complications and hazards when using them in 
  their full generality [ANYCST]. Until more experience has been gained and 
  solutions agreed upon for those problems, the following restrictions are 
  imposed on IPv6 anycast addresses: </P>
  <DD><PRE>      o An anycast address MUST NOT be used as the source address of an
        IPv6 packet.
      o An anycast address MUST NOT be assigned to an IPv6 host, that
        is, it may be assigned to an IPv6 router only.
   2.5.1 Required Anycast Address</PRE>
  <P>The Subnet-Router anycast address is predefined. It's format is as follows: 
  </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |                         n bits                 |   128-n bits   |
    +------------------------------------------------+----------------+
    |                   subnet prefix                | 00000000000000 |
    +------------------------------------------------+----------------+</PRE>
  <P>The "subnet prefix" in an anycast address is the prefix which identifies a 
  specific link. This anycast address is syntactically the same as a unicast 
  address for an interface on the link with the interface identifier set to 
  zero. 
  <P>Packets sent to the Subnet-Router anycast address will be delivered to one 
  router on the subnet. All routers are required to support the Subnet-Router 
  anycast addresses for the subnets which they have interfaces. The 
  subnet-router anycast address is intended to be used for applications where a 
  node needs to communicate with one of a set of routers on a remote subnet. For 
  example when a mobile host needs to communicate with one of the mobile agents 
  on it's "home" subnet. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.6 Multicast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a group of nodes. A node may 
  belong to any number of multicast groups. Multicast addresses have the 
  following format: </P>
  <DD><PRE>    |   8    |  4 |  4 |                  112 bits                   |
    +------ -+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
    |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |
    +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
        11111111 at the start of the address identifies the address as
        being a multicast address.
                                      +-+-+-+-+
        flgs is a set of 4 flags:     |0|0|0|T|
                                      +-+-+-+-+
             The high-order 3 flags are reserved, and must be
             initialized to 0.
             T = 0 indicates a permanently-assigned ("well-known")
             multicast address, assigned by the global internet
             numbering authority.
             T = 1 indicates a non-permanently-assigned ("transient")
             multicast address.
        scop is a 4-bit multicast scope value used to limit the scope of
        the multicast group.  The values are:
             0  reserved
             1  node-local scope
             2  link-local scope
             3  (unassigned)
             4  (unassigned)
             5  site-local scope
             6  (unassigned)
             7  (unassigned)
             8  organization-local scope
             9  (unassigned)
             A  (unassigned)
             B  (unassigned)
             C  (unassigned)
             D  (unassigned)
             E  global scope
             F  reserved
        group ID identifies the multicast group, either permanent or
        transient, within the given scope.</PRE>
  <P>The "meaning" of a permanently-assigned multicast address is independent of 
  the scope value. For example, if the "NTP servers group" is assigned a 
  permanent multicast address with a group ID of 43 (hex), then: </P>
  <DD><PRE>        FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:43 means all NTP servers on the same node as
        the sender.
        FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:43 means all NTP servers on the same link as
        the sender.
        FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:43 means all NTP servers at the same site as
        the sender.
        FF0E:0:0:0:0:0:0:43 means all NTP servers in the internet.</PRE>
  <P>Non-permanently-assigned multicast addresses are meaningful only within a 
  given scope. For example, a group identified by the non- permanent, site-local 
  multicast address FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:43 at one site bears no relationship to a 
  group using the same address at a different site, nor to a non-permanent group 
  using the same group ID with different scope, nor to a permanent group with 
  the same group ID. 
  <P>Multicast addresses must not be used as source addresses in IPv6 datagrams 
  or appear in any routing header. </P>
  <DD><PRE>   2.6.1 Pre-Defined Multicast Addresses</PRE>
  <P>The following well-known multicast addresses are pre-defined: </P>
  <DD><PRE>        Reserved Multicast Addresses:   FF00:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

                                        FF07:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
                                        FF08:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

                                        FF0A:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
                                        FF0B:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
                                        FF0C:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
                                        FF0D:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

                                        FF0F:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</PRE>
  <P>The above multicast addresses are reserved and shall never be assigned to 
  any multicast group. </P>
  <DD><PRE>        All Nodes Addresses:    FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
                                FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</PRE>
  <P>The above multicast addresses identify the group of all IPv6 nodes, within 
  scope 1 (node-local) or 2 (link-local). </P>
  <DD><PRE>        All Routers Addresses:   FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
                                 FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2</PRE>
  <P>The above multicast addresses identify the group of all IPv6 routers, 
  within scope 1 (node-local) or 2 (link-local). </P>
  <DD><PRE>        DHCP Server/Relay-Agent: FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:C</PRE>
  <P>The above multicast addresses identify the group of all IPv6 DHCP Servers 
  and Relay Agents within scope 2 (link-local). </P>
  <DD><PRE>        Solicited-Node Address:  FF02:0:0:0:0:1:XXXX:XXXX</PRE>
  <P>The above multicast address is computed as a function of a node's unicast 
  and anycast addresses. The solicited-node multicast address is formed by 
  taking the low-order 32 bits of the address (unicast or anycast) and appending 
  those bits to the 96-bit prefix FF02:0:0:0:0:1 resulting in a multicast 
  address in the range </P>
  <DD><PRE>           FF02:0:0:0:0:1:0000:0000
   to
           FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FFFF:FFFF</PRE>
  <P>For example, the solicited node multicast address corresponding to the IPv6 
  address 4037::01:800:200E:8C6C is FF02::1:200E:8C6C. IPv6 addresses that 
  differ only in the high-order bits, e.g., due to multiple high-order prefixes 
  associated with different providers, will map to the same solicited-node 
  address thereby reducing the number of multicast addresses a node must join. 
  <P>A node is required to compute and support a Solicited-Node multicast 
  addresses for every unicast and anycast address it is assigned. </P>
