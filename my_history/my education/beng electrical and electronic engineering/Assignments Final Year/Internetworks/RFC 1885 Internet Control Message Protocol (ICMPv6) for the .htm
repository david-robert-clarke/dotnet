  <H2>1. Introduction </H2>
  <DD>The Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of IP. IPv6 uses 
  the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) as defined for IPv4 [<A 
  href="http://194.52.182.96/rfc/rfc792.html">RFC-792</A>], with a number of 
  changes. The Internet Group Membership Protocol (IGMP) specified for IPv4 [<A 
  href="http://194.52.182.96/rfc/rfc1112.html">RFC-1112</A>] has also been 
  revised and has been absorbed into ICMP for IPv6. The resulting protocol is 
  called ICMPv6, and has an IPv6 Next Header value of 58. 
  <P>This document describes the format of a set of control messages used in 
  ICMPv6. It does not describe the procedures for using these messages to 
  achieve functions like Path MTU discovery or multicast group membership 
  maintenance; such procedures are described in other documents (e.g., [<A 
  href="http://194.52.182.96/rfc/rfc1112.html">RFC-1112</A>, <A 
  href="http://194.52.182.96/rfc/rfc1191.html">RFC-1191</A>]). Other documents 
  may also introduce additional ICMPv6 message types, such as Neighbor Discovery 
  messages [IPv6-DISC], subject to the general rules for ICMPv6 messages given 
  in section 2 of this document. 
  <P>Terminology defined in the IPv6 specification [IPv6] and the IPv6 Routing 
  and Addressing specification [IPv6-ADDR] applies to this document as well. 
</P>
  <DT>
  <H2>2. ICMPv6 (ICMP for IPv6) </H2>
  <DD>ICMPv6 is used by IPv6 nodes to report errors encountered in processing 
  packets, and to perform other internet-layer functions, such as diagnostics 
  (ICMPv6 "ping") and multicast membership reporting. ICMPv6 is an integral part 
  of IPv6 and MUST be fully implemented by every IPv6 node. 
  <DT>
  <H2>2.1 Message General Format </H2>
  <DD>ICMPv6 messages are grouped into two classes: error messages and 
  informational messages. Error messages are identified as such by having a zero 
  in the high-order bit of their message Type field values. Thus, error messages 
  have message Types from 0 to 127; informational messages have message Types 
  from 128 to 255. 
  <P>This document defines the message formats for the following ICMPv6 
  messages: </P>
  <DD><PRE>        ICMPv6 error messages:
             1    Destination Unreachable      (see section 3.1)
             2    Packet Too Big               (see section 3.2)
             3    Time Exceeded                (see section 3.3)
             4    Parameter Problem            (see section 3.4)
        ICMPv6 informational messages:
             128  Echo Request                 (see section 4.1)
             129  Echo Reply                   (see section 4.2)
             130  Group Membership Query       (see section 4.3)
             131  Group Membership Report      (see section 4.3)
             132  Group Membership Reduction   (see section 4.3)</PRE>
  <P>Every ICMPv6 message is preceded by an IPv6 header and zero or more IPv6 
  extension headers. The ICMPv6 header is identified by a Next Header value of 
  58 in the immediately preceding header. (NOTE: this is different than the 
  value used to identify ICMP for IPv4.) 
  <P>The ICMPv6 messages have the following general format: </P>
  <DD><PRE>       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |

  <P>The type field indicates the type of the message. Its value determines the 
  format of the remaining data. 
  <P>The code field depends on the message type. It is used to create an 
  additional level of message granularity. 
  <P>The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the ICMPv6 message 
  and parts of the IPv6 header. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>2.2 Message Source Address Determination </H2>
  <DD>A node that sends an ICMPv6 message has to determine both the Source and 
  Destination IPv6 Addresses in the IPv6 header before calculating the checksum. 
  If the node has more than one unicast address, it must choose the Source 
  Address of the message as follows: 
  <DD><PRE>    (a) If the message is a response to a message sent to one of the
        node's unicast addresses, the Source Address of the reply must
        be that same address.
    (b) If the message is a response to a message sent to a multicast or
        anycast group in which the node is a member, the Source Address
        of the reply must be a unicast address belonging to the
        interface on which the multicast or anycast packet was received.
    (c) If the message is a response to a message sent to an address
        that does not belong to the node, the Source Address should be
        that unicast address belonging to the node that will be most
        helpful in diagnosing the error. For example, if the message is
        a response to a packet forwarding action that cannot complete
        successfully, the Source Address should be a unicast address
        belonging to the interface on which the packet forwarding
        failed.
    (d) Otherwise, the node's routing table must be examined to
        determine which interface will be used to transmit the message
        to its destination, and a unicast address belonging to that
        interface must be used as the Source Address of the message.</PRE>
  <DT>
  <H2>2.3 Message Checksum Calculation </H2>
  <DD>The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of 
  the entire ICMPv6 message starting with the ICMPv6 message type field, 
  prepended with a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields, as specified in [IPv6, 
  section 8.1]. The Next Header value used in the pseudo-header is 58. (NOTE: 
  the inclusion of a pseudo-header in the ICMPv6 checksum is a change from IPv4; 
  see [IPv6] for the rationale for this change.) 
  <P>For computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>2.4 Message Processing Rules </H2>
  <DD>Implementations MUST observe the following rules when processing ICMPv6 
  messages (from [<A 
  href="http://194.52.182.96/rfc/rfc1122.html">RFC-1122</A>]): 
  <DD><PRE>    (a) If an ICMPv6 error message of unknown type is received, it MUST
        be passed to the upper layer.
    (b) If an ICMPv6 informational message of unknown type is received,
        it MUST be silently discarded.
    (c) Every ICMPv6 error message (type &lt; 128) includes as much of the
        IPv6 offending (invoking) packet (the packet that caused the
        error) as will fit without making the error message packet
        exceed 576 octets.
    (d) In those cases where the internet-layer protocol is required to
        pass an ICMPv6 error message to the upper-layer protocol, the
        upper-layer protocol type is extracted from the original packet
        (contained in the body of the ICMPv6 error message) and used to
        select the appropriate upper-layer protocol entity to handle the
        error.
        If the original packet had an unusually large amount of
        extension headers, it is possible that the upper-layer protocol
        type may not be present in the ICMPv6 message, due to truncation
        of the original packet to meet the 576-octet limit.  In that
        case, the error message is silently dropped after any IPv6-layer
        processing.
    (e) An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be sent as a result of
        receiving:
         (e.1) an ICMPv6 error message, or
         (e.2) a packet destined to an IPv6 multicast address (there are
               two exceptions to this rule: (1) the Packet Too Big
               Message - Section 3.2 - to allow Path MTU discovery to
               work for IPv6 multicast, and (2) the Parameter Problem
               Message, Code 2 - Section 3.4 - reporting an unrecognized
               IPv6 option that has the Option Type highest-order two
               bits set to 10), or
         (e.3) a packet sent as a link-layer multicast, (the exception
               from e.2 applies to this case too), or
         (e.4) a packet sent as a link-layer broadcast, (the exception
               from e.2 applies to this case too), or
         (e.5) a packet whose source address does not uniquely identify
               a single node -- e.g., the IPv6 Unspecified Address, an
               IPv6 multicast address, or an address known by the ICMP
               message sender to be an IPv6 anycast address.
    (f) Finally, to each sender of an erroneous data packet, an IPv6
        node MUST limit the rate of ICMPv6 error messages sent, in order
        to limit the bandwidth and forwarding costs incurred by the
        error messages when a generator of erroneous packets does not
        respond to those error messages by ceasing its transmissions.
        There are a variety of ways of implementing the rate-limiting
        function, for example:
         (f.1) Timer-based - for example, limiting the rate of
               transmission of error messages to a given source, or to
               any source, to at most once every T milliseconds.
         (f.2)  Bandwidth-based - for example, limiting the rate at
               which error messages are sent from a particular interface
               to some fraction F of the attached link's bandwidth.
        The limit parameters (e.g., T or F in the above examples) MUST
        be configurable for the node, with a conservative default value
        (e.g., T = 1 second, NOT 0 seconds, or F = 2 percent, NOT 100
        percent).</PRE>

   Description</PRE>
  <P>A Destination Unreachable message SHOULD be generated by a router, or by 
  the IPv6 layer in the originating node, in response to a packet that cannot be 
  delivered to its destination address for reasons other than congestion. (An 
  ICMPv6 message MUST NOT be generated if a packet is dropped due to 
  congestion.) 
  <P>If the reason for the failure to deliver is lack of a matching entry in the 
  forwarding node's routing table, the Code field is set to 0 (NOTE: this error 
  can occur only in nodes that do not hold a "default route" in their routing 
  tables). If the reason for the failure to deliver is administrative 
  prohibition, e.g., a "firewall filter", the Code field is set to 1. 
  <P>If the reason for the failure to deliver is that the next destination 
  address in the Routing header is not a neighbor of the processing node but the 
  "strict" bit is set for that address, then the Code field is set to 2. 
  <P>If there is any other reason for the failure to deliver, e.g., inability to 
  resolve the IPv6 destination address into a corresponding link address, or a 
  link-specific problem of some sort, then the Code field is set to 3. 
  <P>A destination node SHOULD send a Destination Unreachable message with Code 
  4 in response to a packet for which the transport protocol (e.g., UDP) has no 
  listener, if that transport protocol has no alternative means to inform the 
  sender. </P>

   Description</PRE>
  <P>If an IPv6 node processing a packet finds a problem with a field in the 
  IPv6 header or extension headers such that it cannot complete processing the 
  packet, it MUST discard the packet and SHOULD send an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem 
  message to the packet's source, indicating the type and location of the 
  problem. 
  <P>The pointer identifies the octet of the original packet's header where the 
  error was detected. For example, an ICMPv6 message with Type field = 4, Code 
  field = 1, and Pointer field = 40 would indicate that the IPv6 extension 
  header following the IPv6 header of the original packet holds an unrecognized 
  Next Header field value. </P>

   Unused         Initialized to zero by the sender; ignored by receivers.
   Multicast Address
                  The address of the multicast group about which the
                  message is being sent.  In Query messages, the Multicast
                  Address field may be zero, implying a query for all
                  groups.
