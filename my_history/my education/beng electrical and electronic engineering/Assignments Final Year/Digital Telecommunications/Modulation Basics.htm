  <H3>What Is Modulation?</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to give a brief description 
  of what modulation is and be able to distinguish between amplitude, phase and 
  frequency modulation.</P>
  <P>
  <P>Modulation is the variation of the characteristics of one signal (the 
  carrier) in proportion to the amplitude of a second, information-carrying 
  signal. Modulation results in the transfer of the signal information to higher 
  or lower frequency. If a sinusoidal carrier is used (as is usually the case) 
  then either the amplitude, frequency or phase of the carrier signal may be 
  modulated giving rise to amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM) 
  or phase modulation (PM) respectively.</P>

  <H3>Digital Modulation</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to describe the basic blocks 
  of digital communications system</P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=175 alt="wpe2.gif (5316 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Digita1.gif" width=681><BR>In the case of digital 
  modulation there are a number of steps which must be taking in encoding and 
  decoding the information for transmission.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Starting from an<STRONG> information source</STRONG> the first step is 
  called <STRONG>source coding</STRONG>. This process maps the information 
  source efficiently into a discrete digital format. If the original source were 
  analogue then source coding corresponds to efficiently representing the signal 
  in a digital format. If the original source is digital then signal compression 
  may be used to increase efficiency. The result is discrete digital data</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>The next process, before modulation is <STRONG>channel coding</STRONG> 
  which maps the discrete data onto format suitable for the characteristics of 
  the transmission system. For example if the transmission introduces errors in 
  the data error control coding, optimised for the specific transmission system, 
  will be required.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Finally the <STRONG>digital modulation</STRONG> maps the discrete digital 
  signal onto an analogue signal for the transmission medium, as all 
  transmission media (excepting quantum based communications which are beyond 
  the scope of this tutorial) are analogue in nature.</P>
  <P></P>

  <H3>Why Modulate?</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to explain why modulation is 
  used in communication systems.</P>
  <P>
  <P>The principle reasons why we need to modulate signals are as follows.</P>
  <DL>
    <DT>To make efficient use of the lines (multiplexing) 
    <DD>
    <P>As already noted a telephone channel is quite intelligible within the 
    300-3400 Hz audio range. Typically coaxial cable has ~ 3MHz bandwidth, and 
    so can accommodates many channels. We therefore need to shift the 
    frequencies of some of the channels so we can pack them together 
    (multiplex)&nbsp; and make full use of the available bandwidth</P>
    <P></P>
    <P></P>
    <DT>To make radio communications feasible 
    <DD>
    <P>Radio antennas are only efficient when approximately the same size as the 
    period of the radio frequency. A 1kHz radio signal has ,a period of&nbsp; 
    300km which is clearly impractical. We therefore need to shift the 
    transmission to higher frequencies with shorter period more practical for 
    transmission. The second advantage of doing this is that we are converting 
    a&nbsp; "broadband" signal into a "narrowband" signal e.g. baseband audio 
    has a bandwidth to frequency ratio of 3400/300 = 11, but modulating that to 
    10 MHz gives 1003400/1000300 = 1.01. Again we can exploit this extra 
    bandwidth for mutiplexing many radio channels.</P>
    <DT>To simplify signal processing 
    <DD>
    <P>It is much simpler to design electronic systems for narrow frequency 
    bands. Using the principle described above we can use modulation to convert 
    a broadband signal to a narrowband signal. Some component types are optimal 
    in a fixed frequency range. Modulation allows us to shift our signal to that 
    range, and example of this is that high gain, high selectivity IF 
    (intermediate frequency) filters are only feasible at certain 
    frequencies.</P></DD></DL>

  <H3>Representations Of Signals And Systems</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to calculate the energy or 
  power of a signal and distinguish between energy and power signals.</P>
  <P>
  <P>We need mathematical tools to develop insight into the transmission of 
  signals in a communications system. Depending on the types of signals and 
  which feature we are interested in we need to distinguish different classes of 
  signals</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <H3 align=left>Periodic and aperiodic signals</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>A signal, <EM>g(t)</EM>&nbsp; is <STRONG>periodic</STRONG> if it satisfies 
  the condition</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><EM>g(t)</EM> =<EM> g(t+T<SUB>0</SUB>)</EM> for all 
  <EM>t</EM></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>where <EM>t</EM> is time and <EM>T<SUB>0</SUB></EM> a constant. 
  <EM>T<SUB>0</SUB></EM> is the period of the signal, the duration of one 
  complete cycle of <EM>g(t)</EM>.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Any signal for which this condition doesn't hold, for any value of 
  <EM>T<SUB>0</SUB></EM> is <EM>aperiodic</EM>.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <H3 align=left>Periodic and aperiodic signals</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>A <STRONG>deterministic </STRONG>signal is a signal for which there is no 
  uncertainty with respect to its value at any time. It may modelled as a 
  completely specified function of time. With a <STRONG>random</STRONG> signal 
  there is an uncertainty in a signal before it occurs, and we can model it only 
  as having a probability of a particular value as a function of time</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <H3>Energy and Power Signals</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>In electrical systems a signal is represented by a voltage or current. If 
  we consider a voltage <EM>v(t)</EM> across a resistor <EM>R</EM> producing 
  current <EM>i(t)</EM> then we may write the <STRONG>instantaneous 
  power</STRONG> dissipated in the resistor as</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P 
  align=center><EM>p</EM>(<EM>t</EM>)=|<EM>v</EM>(<EM>t</EM>)|<SUP>2</SUP>/<EM>R</EM> 
  = |<EM>i</EM>(<EM>t</EM>)|<SUP>2</SUP> <EM>R</EM></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>i.e. the power dissipated is proportional to the signal amplitude (current 
  or voltage) squared. In analysing signals we normalise the calculations by 
  assuming a 1-ohm resistor to we may express the instantaneous power for a 
  signal as</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P 
align=center><EM>p</EM>(<EM>t</EM>)=|<EM>g</EM>(<EM>t</EM>)|<SUP>2</SUP></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Based on this we then have the <STRONG>total energy</STRONG> of a signal 
  <EM>g(t)</EM> defined by</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>!
  <P align=center><IMG height=60 alt="wpe5.gif (1425 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/SigSys1.gif" width=185></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Correspondingly, the <STRONG>average power</STRONG> of of a signal 
  <EM>g(t)</EM> defined by</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>!
  <P align=center><IMG height=70 alt="wpe6.gif (1673 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/SigSys2.gif" width=261></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>For an <STRONG>energy signal </STRONG>the total energy of the signal 
  satisfies the condition</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>!
  <P align=center><IMG height=28 alt="wpe7.gif (1046 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/SigSys3.gif" width=114></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>For a <STRONG>power signal</STRONG> the total energy of the signal 
  satisfies</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>!
  <P align=center><IMG height=26 alt="wpe9.gif (1019 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/SigSys4.gif" width=111></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>These are mutually exclusive conditions. An energy signal has zero average 
  power and a power signal has infinite energy. Usually periodic signals and 
  random signals are power signals, and signals that are deterministic and 
  aperiodic are energy signals.</P>
  <P></P>

  <H3>Representation Of Signals</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>There are many possible ways to represent signals however the most useful, 
  in the context of communications is to represent them as a sum of sinusoidal 
  components of different frequencies and phases. The reasons for this are due 
  to the fact that the response of a system to a sinusoidal input is another 
  sinusoid of the same frequency but with a different amplitude and phase 
  provided</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <OL>
    <LI>
    <P>The system is<STRONG> linear</STRONG> and obeys the <STRONG>principle of 
    superposition</STRONG>. That is if a linear combination of input signals is 
    applied to the system then the output of the system will be a linear sum of 
    the individual outputs that would be obtained if the signals were applied 
    individually.</P>
    <LI>
    <P>The system is <STRONG>time invariant</STRONG>. That is the response of a 
    system to an input that is time delayed is simply time delayed. </P></LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>This leads to the use of <STRONG>Fourier</STRONG> methods for the analysis 
  of signals.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Despite seeing a forest of integration signs when dealing with Fourier 
  methods there is in fact very little integration done, and that which is is at 
  A-level. A familiarity with the theorems associated with <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/ModulationBasics/FourierAnalysis">Fourier 
  analysis</A> together with some basic integration results will solve most 
  common problems. In practice <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/ModulationBasics/FourierAnalysis">Fourier 
  analysis</A> is often done digitally with a minimum of mathematics to, for 
  example,&nbsp; extract information from noisy signals, design electrical 
  filters, and clean TV pictures.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>If a signal is periodic then <STRONG>Fourier series</STRONG> are used to 
  represent the signal as a set of harmonically related sine waves. If the 
  signal however is an energy signal the the<STRONG> Fourier transform</STRONG> 
  is used to represent the signal as a continuous range of sinusoids. Applying 
  these techniques we obtain the <STRONG>frequency-domain</STRONG> 
  representation or <STRONG>spectrum</STRONG> of the signal which we can then 
  use to simplify our analysis of linear systems such as communication 
  systems.</P>

  <H3>FourierSynthesis</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>If a signal waveform is <STRONG>periodic</STRONG>, as shown below, then it 
  contains <STRONG>harmonics</STRONG> (multiples) of the fundamental frequency 
  with various amplitudes and frequencies.</P>
  <P></P>

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>The waveform an be analysed to find the amplitudes of these harmonics, and 
  a list can be made of their various amplitudes and phases. Alternatively we 
  can plot a graph (the <STRONG>spectrum</STRONG>) of the amplitudes versus 
  frequency, as shown below.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=27 alt="wpe2.gif (1980 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Fourie2.gif" width=47></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Mathematically we can express the signal as a sum of these individual 
  frequencies.&nbsp; sines and cosines are needed to allow for the harmonics all 
  having different phases.</P>

  <P>
  <P>In this last form we have use the property cos(<EM>x</EM>)=cos(-<EM>x</EM>) 
  m and sin(<EM>x</EM>)=-sin(-<EM>x</EM>) to change the sum to be between 
  positive integers: <EM>A<SUB>n</SUB>=a<SUB>-n</SUB>+a<SUB>n 
  </SUB>BNB=b<SUB>-n</SUB>-ba<SUB>n</SUB></EM> and <EM>A<SUB>0</SUB></EM> is 
  divided by 2 so we don't count it twice.</P>
  <P></P>

  <P>The process of constructing a waveform by adding together a fundamental 
  frequency and its harmonics of various amplitudes is called <STRONG>Fourier 
  Synthesis</STRONG>.</P>

  <H3>Fourier Analysis</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Given a signal, we often want to extract from it the various frequencies 
  and amplitudes that are present. This is called <STRONG>Fourier 
  Analysis</STRONG>. To find these amplitudes we exploit the 
  <STRONG>orthogonality</STRONG> property of sines and cosines - that is if you 
  take a sine and a cosine, or two sines, or two cosines that are multiples of a 
  fundamental frequency, and integrate them over one cycle of that fundamental 
  period then the result is always zero unless they are the same. 
  Mathematically, if P=1/<FONT face=Symbol>n</FONT><SUB>0</SUB> is one 
period</P>

  <P align=center><IMG height=102 alt="wpe9.gif (2443 bytes)"

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Now if we take our signal function <EM>F</EM>(<EM>t</EM>), multiply it by 
  sin(2<FONT face=Symbol>p</FONT><EM>m</EM><FONT 
  face=Symbol>n</FONT><SUB>0</SUB><EM>t</EM>) and integrate over a single 
  fundamental period we get</P>

  <P>
  <P>Usually when performing <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/ModulationBasics/FourierAnalysis">Fourier

  the formulae than sines and cosines. Using the expression <IMG height=22 
  alt="wpe1.gif (1050 bytes)" src="Modulation Basics_files/Comple1.gif"

  <H3>Non Periodic Functions</H3>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>So far we have looked at periodic functions which can be expressed as a sum 
  of harmonics of the fundamental frequency. If we increase the period of the 
  function then the fundamental frequency and thus the spacing between the 
  harmonics will decrease. A non-periodic function may be treated as the 
  limiting case where the period goes to infinity and the spacing between the 
  Fourier terms goes to zero. Instead of having a spectrum of discrete harmonics 
  the spectrum is a continuous function. Shown below are examples of two 
  non-periodic functions and their spectra - an abrupt <CODE>clash</CODE> type 
  signal and a smooth pulse.</P>

  <P><IMG height=268 alt="wpe2.gif (5250 bytes)"

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Mathematically the summation sign used when expressing periodic signals as 
  a sum of harmonics is changed to an integral and we can write the function in 
  terms of its spectrum as</P>

  the spectrum from the signal itself.</P>

  <P>There are several theorems which are of great use in manipulating 
  Fourier-pairs, and they should be memorised. The art of practical Fourier 
  transforming is in the manipulation of functions using these theorems rather 
  than in doing extensive and tedious elementary integrations. It is this, as 
  much as anything, which makes Fourier theory such a powerful tool for the 
  practical working scientist. Proof of most of these properties is fairly 
  trivial.</P>

        function d(t) applied to the input of the system. 
  </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
  <P>
  <P>This idea arises in many applications - for example the response of a lens 
  to a point image (the point spread function - in 2 dimensions), the response 
  of a spectrometer to a monochromatic source and of course here we have the 
  electrical response of a system to a unit impulse. If the system is 
  time-invariant the it is the same no matter when the impulse is applied to the 
  system.</P>

  be?</P>

  <P>
  <P>We can approximate the input signal <EM>f(t)</EM> by a sum of pulses of 
  width <EM><FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT>t</EM>. As <EM><FONT 
  face=Symbol>D</FONT>t</EM> tends to zero these functions will tend to impulse 
  functions times the amplitude of the signal. The output from the <EM>k</EM>th 
  pulse at time <EM>k<FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT>t</EM> will given by <IMG 
  height=22 alt="wpe9.jpg (1533 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Impuls3.jpg" width=130> where <EM>h(t)</EM> is 
  the impulse response of the system i.e. the pulse will spread out by the 
  impulse response of the system. As <EM><FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT>t</EM> tends 
  to zero these functions will tend to impulse functions times the amplitude of 
  the signal. To find the signal amplitude we need to sum over all the responses 
  from all the pulses giving the <STRONG>Convolutional integral</STRONG> between 
  the input signal and the system impulse response</P>

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>This is often written in the second form since convolution is an operator 
  between functions much like addition and multiplication. It is a very 
  important concept in many different areas of physics and electrical

  <P>
  <P>The importance of this should now become obvious. If we have a linear 
  system (such as a transmission system or filter) and we want to calculate its 
  response we can either, in the time domain, calculate the convolution between 
  the impulse response of the system and the incoming signal or we can, in the 
  frequency domain, multiply the frequency response of the system with the 
  spectrum of the signal. The latter is usually very much easier than the former 
  which is why we often work in the frequency domain. Note that the inverse 
  process is also true due to the invertability of Fourier transforms - 
  convolution in the frequency domain corresponds to multiplication in the time

  <P>The convolution integral is <IMG height=50 alt="wpeE.jpg (1938 bytes)"

  or compensate for imperfections in the transmission process.&nbsp; Generally 
  the frequency response is used in describing such systems since we can 
  calculate the overall response of a system using multiplications of the 
  frequency response functions. In the time domain we would have to perform 
  convolutional integrals which are much harder. In the system shown above we

  filters. A low pass filter only transmits frequencies below a certain value, 
  the opposite is a high pass filter which only transmits a frequency above a 
  certain value. We may also have a bandpass or bandstop filter which transmits 
  or block frequencies inside a certain range. In all cases the bandwidth of the

  <H3>Causality And Stability</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to describe the conditions on 
  a system response required to satisfy causality and stability</P>
  <P>
  <P>A system is said to be <STRONG>causal</STRONG> if it does not respond 
  before the signal is applied. For a linear time-invariant system it is clear 
  that this means that the impulse response <EM>h(t)</EM> must vanish for 
  negative time.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=22 alt="wpe2.jpg (1210 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Causal1.jpg" width=91></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Obviously a system operating in real-time must be causal. We have already 
  seen how the ideal low-pass filter is non-causal and therefore not physically 
  realisable since its impulse response is a sinc function which extends to 
  negative time. However in applications where the signal is stored before 
  processing the response may be noncausal and yet physically realisable. 
  Storing the signal can be thought of as delaying it - the more of the signal 
  we store the longer it is delayed and the more of the leading part of impulse 
  response we can represent. In terms of our low pass filter, the more we delay 
  the signal the more of the leading edge ripples of the impulse response we can 
  represent, the sharper the filter cut off and&nbsp; and the closer we can 
  approach the ideal response. This is generally true - the more we delay a 
  signal in the filter the sharper the features in the spectral response we can 
  represent. Infinitely sharp features would however require that we delay the 
  signal for infinitely long.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>A second requirement we place on a system is that of stability by which we 
  mean that the output is bounded for all input signals. This is called the 
  <STRONG>bounded input-bounded output (BIBO) stability</STRONG> criterion. An 
  input signal is bounded if</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=28 alt="wpe4.jpg (1165 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Causal2.jpg" width=66></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>where <EM>M</EM> is a positive real finite number. The output, for a linear 
  time-invariant system, is given by the <A 
  href="http://benedick.aston.ac.uk:8080/tutorials/paths/ModulationBasics/Impulse%20Response.htm">convolution

  <P>
  <P>It follows that we require this to be bounded and therefore we find that 
  the impulse response must be absolutely integrable.</P>

  <H3>Pulse Response of an Ideal Low-pass Filter</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to derive the pulse response

  <P>Now we want to calculate the response of such a filter to a rectangular

  <P>We cannot write this integral in terms of other functions, it has to be

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Our response is therefore made up of the difference between two sine 
  integrals - one corresponding to the leading edge and one to the trailing 
  edge. The exact form depends on the filter bandwidth , and below it is plotted 
  for 3 different ratios of bandwidth to pulse width.<IMG height=380 
  alt="wpeF.jpg (23685 bytes)" src="Modulation Basics_files/Pulse_12.jpg" 
  width=474 align=right> If the bandwidth is very narrow (the green line) we see 
  that the output is spread out over a long time. If the output equals the 
  bandwidth (the blue line) the output shape is slightly broadened. In most 
  cases the bandwidth of the filter will be much broader than this (the red 
  line).</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Those of you who have ever looked at the response of a pulse on an 
  oscilloscope will be familiar with this shape.Important points to notice are 
  that there is overshoot (of about 9% usually) and undershoot, and there are 
  oscillations in the response. This is called <STRONG>Gibbs</STRONG> 
  <STRONG>Phenomena</STRONG>. The period of these oscillations is proportional 
  to the reciprocal of the filter bandwidth.</P>

  <H3>Frequency Translation</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to calculate the spectrum for 
  a heterodyned signal in terms of the carrier and the baseband spectrum</P>
  <P>
  <P>As discussed earlier one of the important reasons for modulation is to 
  carry out frequency translation. We take a signal and a carrier and multiply 
  them together to produce a mixing or heterodyne signal. For a sinusoidal 
  signal we have</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=215 alt="wpe10.jpg (11438 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Freque13.jpg" width=452></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=333 alt="wpe11.jpg (13649 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Freque14.jpg" width=474 align=right>Looking at 
  the spectrum, we the sinusoidal signal has two delta functions at +/- 
  f<SUB>m</SUB>. Multiplying this by the sinusoidal carrier produces the sum and 
  difference frequencies - a total of 4 peaks in the double sided spectrum. One 
  way of looking at this is that we have taken the original spectrum and shifted 
  it up to the carrier frequency.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>A common mistake that is made is to forget that the spectrum is double 
  sided - has both positive and negative frequencies. This is because quite 
  often instruments (such as the spectrum analyser) only plot the positive half 
  of the spectrum. For real signals, the amplitude spectrum is symmetric, and 
  the phase spectrum is anti-symmetric, and so there is no need extra 
  information negative half of the spectrum. On such a spectrum analyser we 
  would only see a single peak for the signal sinusoidal frequency. However when 
  we multiply this signal by the carrier we shift the <STRONG>entire</STRONG> 
  spectrum up by the carrier frequency and so we see two peaks in the spectrum. 
  </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=251 alt="wpe12.jpg (10659 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Freque15.jpg" width=372 align=right>This 
  principle of course applies for general signals so for a periodic 
  non-sinusoidal signal we have a spectrum made up of a set of discrete 
  frequencies separated by the period of the signal. Heterodyning this with a 
  sinusoidal carrier shifts the entire double sided spectrum as shown here. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>And similarly for a general aperiodic signal which has a continuous 
  spectrum. Another important point to note about this process is that we 
  effectively see a doubling of the bandwidth of the signal as when heterodyning 
  we see both halves of the original spectrum at positive frequencies.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=315 alt="wpe13.jpg (13987 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Freque16.jpg" width=401 align=right>Another 
  important aspect of frequency translation is that out analysis for the ideal 
  low pass filter can also be applied for bandpass filters since they are 
  equivalent except for the frequency translation of both signal and filter. 
  Haykin deals with proving this is some detail. The most important thing to 
  remember is that there is a factor of 2 difference in the bandwidth definition 
  between the two, and this must be taken into account in the calculations. In 
  particular we can represent a bandpass filter response <EM>H(f)</EM> in terms 
  of an equivalent low pass transfer function as follows</P>

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>i.e. we take the part of the passband transfer function corresponding to 
  positive frequencies, shift it to the origin and multiply by 2.</P>

  <H3>Phase And Group Delay</H3>
  <P>On completing this section you should be able to distinguish between the 
  phase and group delay and calculate them for a given linear system</P>
  <P>
  <P>When a signal is passed through a dispersive (frequency-selective) device 
  some delay is introduced. In an ideal low-pass filter the phase response 
  varies linearly with frequency and a constant delay is introduced. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>To start with we will consider a frequency which suffers a phase shift 
  total of <IMG height=21 alt="wpe16.jpg (986 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2018.jpg" width=42> radians. The equivalent 
  delay suffered will simply be given by</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=46 alt="wpe17.jpg (1159 bytes)"

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>seconds. The is called the <STRONG>phase delay</STRONG> of the channel. 
  This is not necessarily the true delay of the channel - after all a sinusoidal 
  signal carries no information. We must modulate the sinusoid to carry 
  information, and it is the delay of the modulating envelope that we are often 
  really interested in. This delay is called the <STRONG>envelope</STRONG> or 
  <STRONG>group delay</STRONG> of the channel.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>In general the phase response of our <STRONG>dispersive</STRONG> 
  <STRONG>channel</STRONG> is a function of frequency, i.e. we have <IMG 
  height=22 alt="wpe19.jpg (973 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2020.jpg" width=41>. An example is plotted 
  below</P>
  <P></P>

  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Here I am going to show what I hope is a simple way of viewing the group 
  delay. Haykin does a more complete calculation. We are going to a consider a 
  signal consisting of two sinusoidal components separated by a small frequency 
  step <FONT face=Symbol color=#000000 size=4>dw</FONT></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Thus we have at&nbsp; the input</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=86 alt="wpe1C.jpg (3884 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2022.jpg" width=249></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>where we have rewritten the input in terms of the envelope component at 
  frequency <FONT face=Symbol>dw</FONT> and a carrier frequency component.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P><IMG height=193 alt="wpe1D.jpg (20508 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2023.jpg" width=598></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>At the output of the channel or system we have a delay of <FONT 
  face=Symbol>b</FONT> for frequency <FONT face=Symbol>w</FONT> and a delay of 
  <FONT face=Symbol>b+db</FONT> for frequency <FONT face=Symbol>w+dw</FONT> 
  giving the output signal as</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=97 alt="wpe1E.jpg (6540 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2024.jpg" width=395></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>Again we have separated the output into the envelope and carrier. Comparing 
  the envelope component at the output with that at the input we see that it has 
  a phase delay of <FONT face=Symbol>db</FONT> and is at frequency <FONT 
  face=Symbol>dw</FONT> so the group delay is given by</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=42 alt="wpe1F.jpg (1176 bytes)" 
  src="Modulation Basics_files/Phase%2025.jpg" width=55></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <P>More generally if we have a more complex signal we need to consider the 
  relative relationship between all the frequency components. Clearly if there 
  is to be no distortion the relative delay between all the components must be 
  the same i.e. the derivative of the phase with frequency must be a 
  constant.</P>
