<P>ShellyLib is a small set of C-programs for generating seashell or snail
shapes.
ShellyLib supports many common file formats, see section
<A HREF="sl-8.html#sec-outp">Output Formats</A>, and has been designed to be as
portable as possible.</P>
<P>In contrast to Shelly (the ancestor), ShellyLib is not
Freeware but Shareware.
Please read the file <CODE>"License"</CODE>  in the top level of the
distribution for further information.</P>
<P>ShellyLib contains a small library (<CODE>"libshelly"</CODE>) and a GUI called
<CODE>"Shell Laboratory"</CODE>, in addition it is possible to compile
a command line driven shell generator (<CODE>"shelly"</CODE>).</P>
<P>The <CODE>"Shell Laboratory"</CODE> is written in Tcl/Tk and C,
and uses OpenGL for immediate rendering of the generated shells.</P>
<P>The algorithm used to generate the shells is an extended
version of the algorithm by M.B. Cortie, found in Computer and Graphics,
Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 79-84, 1993, "Digital Seashells".
