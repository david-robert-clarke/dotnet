<P>Changes from V2.1 to V2.2 are:
<UL>
<LI>General Changes:
<UL>
<LI>A new parameter named <CODE>"alpha2</CODE>" has been introduced.
This works much like alpha. It allows to adjust the growth rate
of the generating curve without affecting the helico spiral.
Oops? Read section
<A HREF="sl-5.html#sec-para">Parameters of the Shell Generator</A>
for more information.</LI>
<LI>The 3DMF (3D MetaFile) output format has been added;
NURBS and triangles are supported.</LI>
<LI>The RIB output now contains own texture coordinates, that improve
the texture mapping quality. This change is only visible for
custom generating curves (GCURVE-mode) where the points are not
uniformly distributed.</LI>
<LI>A new simple shader (SLtxtsrf) for RenderMan has been added,
that maps the generated textures on the shells just like the <CODE>"Shell
Laboratory"</CODE> does. Besides that, it shows how to use the custom
texture coordinates of the RIB output.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Changes to the Shell Laboratory:
<UL>
<LI>Several changes to the hotkeys in the 3D-View and other places
have been made.</LI>
<LI>A new RIB output mode (export scene) has been added.
This mode saves all movements and rotations etc. you made in the
3D-View as well as the shell.</LI>
<LI>Texture-mapping quality in the 3D-View has been improved
for the NURBS rendering mode. This change is only visible for
custom generating curves (GCURVE-mode) where the points are not
uniformly distributed.</LI>
<LI>Loading of values (via .shy-files) with higher resolution
as the corresponding slider allows has been corrected.
The sliders resolution is now recalculated according to the loaded value.</LI>
<LI>Added Antialiasing via viewing-volume-jittering to the
rendering code.
This improves overall rendering quality and works in all rendering modes,
although it is not meant to be used with the wireframe mode.
Two levels of antialiasing are available.</LI>
<LI>Added a status-bar, that keeps you informed about whats going
on at the moment.</LI>
<LI>Added simple (single step) undo to the texture generator.</LI>
<LI>Added simple image operations (mix, add, sub) to the texture
generator. The new texture may be combined with the older one using
this operations.</LI>
<LI>Exporting the image of the 3D-View did not work when it
was resized, fixed.</LI>
<LI>The ambient, diffuse, specular and background color of
the shell/view may be changed separately now. Check
the <CODE>"Color"</CODE> submenu of the <CODE>"Preferences"</CODE> menu.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Changes from V2.0 to V2.1 are:
<UL>
<LI>General Changes:
<UL>
<LI>Due to the low registration moral (I received one (!)
registration request, thank you!) the license changed again.
Please read the file <CODE>"License"</CODE> in the top level of the distribution.
Important changes are that I do not release the source for free
anymore and I crippled
the free available executables of the Shell Laboratory.
Registered users can still get the full source, however.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"libshelly"</CODE> now simulates that the walls of the generated
shells have a certain thickness, new parameters are <CODE>"wall"</CODE>
and <CODE>"wlen"</CODE> (see section 
<A HREF="sl-5.html#sec-para">Parameters of the Shell Generator</A> for more information).</LI>
<LI>Nodules are now possible in the <CODE>"GCurve"</CODE> mode.</LI>
<LI>The DXF output format has been added;
Splines, polyface-meshes and 3dfaces are supported.</LI>
<LI>The RIB output now contains NURBS instead of B-Splines.</LI>
<LI>The RenderMan shaders have been rewritten. They do respect
the new wall feature now. </LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Changes to the Shell Laboratory:
<UL>
<LI>The Shell Laboratory has been ported to WinNT/95.</LI>
<LI>The Shell Laboratory is now available as
stand-alone executable that does not need a bunch of .tcl-files or an
installed Tcl/Tk at all. Precompiled executables are available for
Linux, WinNT/95 and Irix.</LI>
<LI>Several changes to the GUI (menu layout, hotkeys etc.)
have been made.</LI>
<LI>The smooth-shaded rendering mode has been replaced by NURBS
rendering using GLU.</LI>
<LI>Another rendering mode (NURBS+Wire) has been
introduced. This mode displays a NURBS surface and the associated
control polygon.</LI>
<LI>A generation curve editor has been added to the Shell Laboratory,
see section 
<A HREF="sl-4.html#sec-gce">The Generation Curve Editor</A>
for more information.</LI>
<LI>A texture generator has been added, that utilizes the algorithms
published in "The Algorithmic Beauty of Sea Shells" by H. Meinhardt (see
section 
<A HREF="sl-9.html#sec-poin">Addresses, Pointers, Literature</A>
for a complete reference, and section 
<A HREF="sl-4.html#sec-te">The Texture Editor</A> for the documentation).</LI>
<LI>It is now possible to export the rendered image.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>A lot has changed from version 1.6 of Shelly (the ancestor of ShellyLib)
to version 2.0:
<UL>
<LI>Legalities have changed, read the file <CODE>"License"</CODE>!</LI>
<LI>Almost everything has been completely rewritten,
therefore, I suggest to reread the whole documentation, even if you feel
familiar with Shelly!</LI>
<LI>Bezier output for POV-Ray creates really smooth surfaces now.</LI>
<LI>Several new output formats, e.g. Truespace, RIB, SCED, have been added.</LI>
<LI>The handling of scale factors has changed. There are file format
dependant scale factors now, to ensure a unique size of the generated
shells over the variety of output formats.</LI>
<LI>ShellyLib has a really cool GUI now, unfortunately, it is not as
nearly as portable as the library itself.</LI>
<LI>The former "NewNod" mode is now called "Nodule" and has been
improved in terms of speed and usability. The old "Nodule"
mode is gone.</LI>
<LI>The code has been split into several parts.
The shell generation is done by a small library called <CODE>"libshelly"</CODE>.
Furthermore, there are two example frontends that use the library
<CODE>"shelly"</CODE> and the <CODE>"Shell Laboratory"</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>The original algorithm of M.B. Cortie is limited to ellipsoid
generation curves. ShellyLibV2.0 allows the user to define any generation
curve in a special new calculation mode called "GenCurve".
This is useful for Cones or the "Miraculous Thatcheria", which were
impossible to generate with the old algorithm.</LI>
<LI>Some special keywords regarding POV-Ray are gone. </LI>
<LI>Various other goodies have been included in the distribution,
for instance displacement and surface shaders for RenderMan
and a reference sheet that helps to understand the algorithm.</LI>
</UL>
