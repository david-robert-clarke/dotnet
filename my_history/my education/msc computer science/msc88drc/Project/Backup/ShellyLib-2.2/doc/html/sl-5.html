<P>The basic idea of the algorithm is to simulate a shell shape
by rotating a growing ellipse around the z-axis, and simultaneously
displacing it from the z-axis. This results in a flat spiral.
If we move the ellipse along the z-axis while rotating, a shell
like shape will appear. The curve determined by all centers of all
ellipses is a so called helico-spiral.</P>
<P>The parameters of this process are divided into 5 groups.
Parameters that need to be given in degrees are marked with an asterisk ("*").</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Angular Parameters:</B><DD><P>These parameters change the shape of the
helico-spiral (<CODE>"alpha"</CODE>* and <CODE>"beta"</CODE>*) and the tilt of
the ellipse against the axes of the local coordinate system of the ellipse
(<CODE>"phi"</CODE>*, <CODE>"my"</CODE>*, <CODE>"omega"</CODE>*). Note, that <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>* does
determine the growth rate of the ellipse too.</P>
<P><CODE>"alpha2"</CODE>* is a new parameter that has been introduced
with V2.2. It works much like <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>* but it only changes the
growth rate of the generating curve. At its default setting
of 90.0, no change to the original growth rate takes place. At a higher
value it will decrease the growth rate determined by <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>*
and vice versa. Due to the dependence from <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>* you have
to find a new value for <CODE>"alpha2"</CODE>* every time <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>* is changed!
See the new <CODE>"Snail.shy"</CODE> for an example.</P>

<DT><B>Linear Parameters:</B><DD><P>They change the size (and shape) of the
ellipse (<CODE>"a"</CODE>, <CODE>"b"</CODE>) and the distance of the first ellipses
center from the z-axis (<CODE>"A"</CODE>).</P>

<DT><B>Dimensional Parameters:</B><DD><P>They set how many ellipses are calculated
(<CODE>"omin"</CODE>*, <CODE>"omax"</CODE>*, <CODE>"od"</CODE>*), and how many points
on each ellipse are calculated (<CODE>"smin"</CODE>*, <CODE>"smax"</CODE>*, <CODE>"sd"</CODE>*).
Finally, a global scale-factor, independent from all file format specific
scaling, might be applied using <CODE>"Scale"</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>Nodule Parameters:</B><DD><P>Change all aspects of nodules, position on the
ellipse (<CODE>"P"</CODE>*), size (<CODE>"W1"</CODE>*, <CODE>"W2"</CODE>*), length (<CODE>"L"</CODE>),
number of nodules per whorl (<CODE>"N"</CODE>) and starting point on
the spiral (<CODE>"Nstart"</CODE>*).</P>
<P>There are three independent groups of nodules.
Add a <CODE>"2"</CODE> to each nodule parameter to set parameters
of the second nodule group. Length of second nodule is therefore <CODE>"L2"</CODE>.
Do the same for the third nodule, with a <CODE>"3"</CODE>.
There are two more parameters to control an offset between the three groups
of nodules, <CODE>"Off2"</CODE>* is the offset between nodule 1 and nodule 2 and
<CODE>"Off3"</CODE>* is the offset between nodule 1 and nodule 3.</P>

<DT><B>Nodule-Mode Parameters:</B><DD><P><CODE>"Scano"</CODE>, <CODE>"Scans"</CODE>, <CODE>"Hdo"</CODE>,
<CODE>"Hds"</CODE> refer to section 
<A HREF="sl-6.html#sec-calc">Calculation Modi</A>
for information on this parameters.</P>

<DT><B>Wall Parameters:</B><DD><P><CODE>"wall"</CODE> defines the thickness
of the wall in terms of <CODE>"a"</CODE> and <CODE>"b"</CODE> and <CODE>"wlen"</CODE>*
defines how many degrees into the interior of the shell
the wall should be computed. A simple trick allows the calculation of
the inner walls:</P>
<P> At the aperture of the shell <CODE>"a"</CODE> and <CODE>"b"</CODE>
are multiplied with <CODE>"wall"</CODE> and then the shell generator computes
the interior with negative <CODE>"od"</CODE>.</P>
<P>The wall feature is a big win for realism, now even views
of the aperture of the shell do not reveal the synthetic nature
of the shell easily.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, simple scaling of the generating curve does not
yield best results in every case, namely the GCURVE-mode.</P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>The most important parameters are <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>, <CODE>"beta"</CODE>, <CODE>"A"</CODE>,
<CODE>"a"</CODE> and <CODE>"b"</CODE>.</P>
<P>Here are some hints on how certain values change the shape of the shell.
<UL>
<LI>Alpha 90 means no growing of the ellipse and no spiral shape at all.
If beta is 90, too, this will produce a torus like shape. If alpha gets
smaller the spiral will form and the ellipse will grow.</LI>
<LI>Beta 90 means no moving of the ellipse along z-axis. This is fine
for shells like "Nautilus", "Planorbis", "Ammonite" or several
cockles. If you want to shape a "Turritella" or "Natalina" you have to
decrease beta.</LI>
<LI>The meaning of a certain value of A depends highly on a and b. 
Generally, A should be higher as a and b, otherwise the shell may look 
like a sphere.</LI>
</UL>
