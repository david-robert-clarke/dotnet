1. Java background

Why is Java?

  * Because people wanted a portable programming language for the Internet 
  * They wanted it to be simpler than C++ 
  * But at the same time they wanted it to be more object oriented than C++ 

Thus, people at Sun Microsystems Inc. created a language which claims to be: 

  * Simple (at least to C++ programmers) 
  * Object-oriented 
  * Distributed (i.e. network aware) 
  * Architecture Neutral (runs in Java Virtual Machine) 
  * Portable (JVM is provided for many architectures) 
  * Interpreted (but also compiled) 
  * Robust (no pointers, garbage collected, exceptions handled) 
  * Secure (runs in web pages) 
  * High-performance (when compiled to real machines) 
  * Multi-threaded 
  * Dynamic 

Many of the above are the subject of a heated debate. Decide for yourself if it is really the case. Undoubtedly, Java has become very popular, and is indeed the language of the Internet.

2. Variables, constants and literals

Variable declaration

    <type> <variable name>;

    e.g.

    int houseNumber; 

Note: Every Java statement ends with a semicolon.

Note: The convention in Java is to name variables by concatenating meaningful words and capitalising the first letter of each word, except for the first one. The first letter of the first word is capitalised only in type names.

Assignment

    houseNumber = 10; 

Declaration with initialisation

    int houseNumber = 10; 

Constants

    final float SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 2.997925e8; 

Note: By convention names of constants are capitalised with the underscore used to separate words.

Primitive types

    byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, boolean 

Note: Java does not support unsigned types.

Literals

     byte, short, int, long 
                                e.g.
                                       10, -23, 012, 0xD5 
     char 
                                e.g.
                                       'a', '\n', '\141', '\u001E'
     float, double 
                                e.g.
                                       0.6667, 314159E-05, 8.0f
     boolean 
                                e.g.
                                       true, false 
     String 
                                e.g.
                                       "some text" 


Note: Floating point literals are double precision by default. In order to make it single precision, append f or F at the end of the literal.

Type conversion

    byte leanHouseNumber = (byte)houseNumber; 

3. Operators

  * Arithmetic:   +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
  * Bitwise:      ~, &, |, ^, <<, >>, >>> 
  * Relational:   ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 
  * Boolean:      &, |, ^, ||, &&, !, ==, != 
  * Assignment operators. Arithmetic, bitwise and boolean operators can be
    combined with the assignment operator '=' for shorter syntax, e.g. 

        a *= 2; 

    instead of 

        a = a * 2; 

    The assignment operator can be chained, e.g. 

        a = b = c = 100; 

  * The ? operator: e.g. 

        c = a != 0 ? b / a : 0; 

  * Operators + and += are also defined for Strings. In this context they
    perform string concatenation. 

4. Control structures

Branching

     if (choice == 'Q')
        // quit
     else
     {
        /* do something more complex here
        ...
        */
     }

If a branch contains more than one statement, you enclose it with curly braces.

     switch (choice)
     {
        case 'a':
           // do something here
           break;
        case 'Q':
           // do something here
           break;
        default:
           // do something here
     }

Iteration

     for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        // do something 10 times here

     while (expression)
        // do something for as long as expression is true

     do
        // do something for as long as expression is true
     while (expression);

Note: If you've programmed in C, you'll find that in Java you cannot say e.g.

   int counter = initialValue;
   while (counter) ...

Java requires a boolean value as the condition, so you have to say

   while (counter != 0) ... 

5. Objects and classes

OO primer

  * Objects are representations of what humans like to think of as whole
    entities, physical or abstract: cars, documents, windows on the computer
    screen, internet connections, etc. 
  * Classes are what humans tend to classify objects into. E.g. John Smith's
    Vauxhall Vectra and Sue Wilson's Ford Fiesta are both cars, i.e. they
    belong to class Car. In other words, they are instances (objects) of class
    Car. 
  * In OO (object oriented) design classes provide the object's structure. This
    is made up from data members (variables), e.g. car make, owner, current
    speed, etc., and methods (subroutines) which are the actions a class
    instance can perform, e.g. change owner, accelerate, etc. In other words,
    objects package together actions and state. 

OO design example

Requirements: Design and implement a computer address book. The book will store a list of personal details of any number of people, in particular, their surname, first name, address, and telephone number. The user should be able to enter a new person's details, edit them, and remove from the address book. Retrieval of a person's details will be actioned upon supplying the required person's surname. The user should also be able to save the contents of the address book in a file, and retrieve it later.

Class breakdown:

   Class Address Book                  Class Person

   Data members:                       Data members:

      list of Person objects              first name
      number of people in the list        surname
                                          address
                                          telephone number 

   Methods:                            Methods:

      add new person                      change first name
      change person details               change surname
      remove person                       change address
      search for a person                 change telephone number
                                          get first name
                                          get surname
                                          get address
                                          get telephone number 

Example implementation in Java

   class Person
   {
      private String firstName, surname, address, telephoneNumber;

      Person(String fn, String sn, String a, String t)
      {
         firstName = fn;
         surname = sn;
         address = a;
         telephoneNumber = t;
      }

      Person()
      {
         firstName = "";
         surname = "";
         address = "";
         telephoneNumber = "";
      }

      void setFirstName(String newFirstName)
      {
         firstName = newFirstName;
      }

      String getFirstName()
      {
         return firstName;
      }

      // other similar methods
   }

Note: Method names, like variable names start with a lower case letter. The class names start with upper case.

The first two methods in the class declaration are its constructors. Constructors always have the same name as the class itself. They are called whenever a new instance of the class is created. Note that the ones shown
here are overloaded i.e. they are two versions of essentially one constructor/method. The Java compiler decides which one to choose depending on the list of arguments in the method call.

The following code fragment shows how objects are instantiated and referred to.

   Person person = new Person();
   person.setFirstName("Arkadius");

Static members

Static data members are variables or constants whose value is paramount to all instances of a class. Constants are often made static, since their value usually applies to all instances, e.g.

   class AddressBook
   {
      static final int MAX_NUMBER_OF_RECORDS = 1000;
      ...
   }

If a method is declared static, it can only operate on static variables and constants.
