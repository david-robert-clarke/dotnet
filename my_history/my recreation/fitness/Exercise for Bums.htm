      size=5>Bums<BR><FONT size=2>By Ed Starkie BSc</FONT> 
      </FONT></FONT><BR><FONT size=2><BR><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">As in the case of your legs, the main 
      culprit for causing the deposits around the bottom area is saturated fat 
      in the diet. It is advisable to cut it out of your diet if possible, as it 
      is bad for you in a variety of different ways. However, it is not 
      necessary to go on a crash diet in order to go some way towards shifting 
      these deposits. It is merely necessary to cut out the rubbish that you eat 
      and replace it with quality nutrients which will aid your body's 
      metabolism.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Again, as with shifting cellulite 
      around your thighs, an increase in activity is recommended. However, for 
      the purpose of firming up your buttocks (Gluteals), there are a few 
      aerobic exercises which will not only burn fat but work the Gluteal 
      muscles as well. The first of these is rowing which gives a good all round 
      workout, helping you to burn a large majority of fat if you exercise at 
      around 40% of your theoretical maximum heart rate (use 220- your age for 
      this calculation). However, it also uses your buttocks in the rowing 
      action and therefore has a significant firming effect. The same can be 
      said for swimming. As well as being an extremely good exercise for burning 
      fat (due to the fact that you are usually working at a relatively low 
      intensity) the leg action involves the buttocks in every stroke, 
      especially the breaststroke.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Finally you will need to carry out 
      some buttock-specific exercises as follows: </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mule Kicks</B> </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">When it comes to buttock-specific 
      exercises, one of the best is the mule kick (or donkey-kick). Position 
      yourself on all fours on the floor using a mat to protect your knees. 
      Supporting yourself on one knee, bring the other up towards your chest and 
      through towards your chin. Then push it backwards and upwards, 
      straightening your leg in the process until it is pointing up into the 
      air. At this point, squeeze your buttock muscles and hold for 2 seconds 
      before releasing and repeating the exercise. This should be done 10 times 
      on both legs. This exercise, if done correctly, should give you a real 
      burn. </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Seated Squats</B> </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">As 
      mentioned in the 'Legs' section of this week's Focus. This exercise is 
      also known as the Leg Press and is extremely good for all muscle groups in 
      the legs, but particularly the thighs and gluteals. Also it can be 
      performed with less than bodyweight as resistance which is safer than 
      performing normal squats and creates less stress around the knee 
      joint.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Step-Ups</B> </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">As 
      well as being generally good for the thighs, this exercise can also be 
      adapted to benefit the gluteals. When performing the step-up, the buttocks 
      can be exercised by tensing your trailing leg buttock just as you push off 
      the floor. Again, this exercise should be repeated around 10 times per leg 
      and intensity can be increased with extra reps or by carrying 
      weights.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Leg Abductions</B> </FONT></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#003333 
      face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Abductions (so called because they 
      exercises the Abductor muscles which run down the outside of your thighs) 
      involve lying on your side with your whole body in-line, then raising your 
      top leg up in the air as high as possible. The leg should then be returned 
      to a horizontal position without letting it touch the lower leg (this 
      ensures that the upper leg abductor is constantly exercised). This should 
      be repeated on both legs 10 times. This exercise not only exercises the 
      abductors but also the gluteals when your leg is at the top of its 
      lift</FONT>. </FONT>
